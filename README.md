# VIB34D Holographic Visualization Engine

A WebGL-based 4D mathematics visualization system with 4 different rendering engines.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and navigate
cd v2-refactored-mobile-fix

# Start local server
python3 -m http.server 8080

# Open in browser
http://localhost:8080/index-clean.html
```

### 🎯 Lattice Pulse – Mobile Roguelite

The **Lattice Pulse** mode now plays as an endless, audio-reactive roguelite run that reuses the faceted, quantum, and holographic renderers without spinning up extra WebGL contexts.

- Launch the PWA: `http://localhost:8080/lattice-pulse.html` and tap the start screen to arm audio playback.
- Each run descends through curated depth tiers—geometry + system pairings stay fixed per depth while difficulty, spawn density, and shader LOD scale dynamically with your score, combo, and survival time.
- A new Event Director listens to bass/mid/high energy to schedule drops, glitch reversals, rhythm slowdowns, and quick-draw mini events that punctuate bridges and beat collapses.
- Audio-reactive micro directives now pop up during drops and bridges—swipe, pinch, or hold on command to earn bonus score, shields, and difficulty surges while the HUD blasts out WarioWare-style prompts.
- Controls: **tap** to pulse, **swipe** to steer 4D rotation, **pinch** for dimension shifts, **double-tap** to trigger a time-warp slow motion, **triple-tap** to cash in an extra life, **long-press** for a shielded phase shift, and optional **tilt** for drift correction.
- Runs as a deterministic 60 Hz loop with audio-driven spawns, adaptive LOD, and offline caching via `sw-lattice-pulse.js`; progress and best depth/scores persist locally.

## 🎮 The 4 Systems

**🔷 FACETED** - Simple 2D geometric patterns  
**🌌 QUANTUM** - Complex 3D lattice effects  
**✨ HOLOGRAPHIC** - Audio-reactive visualizations  
**🔮 POLYCHORA** - True 4D polytope mathematics  

Switch between systems using the top navigation buttons. All systems share the same 11-parameter control system.

## 📱 Mobile Support

Mobile performance is optimized. The system loads quickly on phones and runs at 45-60 FPS on most devices.

## 🎨 Features

- **Real-time 4D mathematics** with WebGL rendering
- **11 parameter control system** with live updates  
- **Gallery system** for saving/loading configurations
- **Trading card export** in multiple formats
- **Audio reactivity** in holographic system
- **Cross-system compatibility** - parameters work across all engines

## 🔧 Development

Main files:
- `index-clean.html` - Main interface (427 lines)
- `js/core/app.js` - System controller  
- `js/controls/ui-handlers.js` - Parameter controls
- `src/` - Engine implementations

CSS is modularized in `styles/` directory. All JavaScript uses ES6 modules with graceful fallbacks.

## 📊 Status

✅ All systems operational  
✅ Mobile optimized  
✅ No critical issues  
✅ Ready for use
