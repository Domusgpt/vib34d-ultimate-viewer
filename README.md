# VIB34D Adaptive Interface Platform (Prototype)

The VIB34D visualization engine now includes an experimental adaptive layer aimed at wearable, ambient, and projection-first interfaces. The current codebase demonstrates the concept but still requires significant engineering work before it can be marketed as a supported SDK. Start here to understand the available pieces and how we plan to evolve them.

## üöÄ Quick Start (Concept Demo)

```bash
# Clone and navigate
cd vib34d-ultimate-viewer

# Start local server (no build tooling required)
python3 -m http.server 8080

# Open the wearable/ambient demo shell
http://localhost:8080/wearable-designer.html
```

> **Note:** `wearable-designer.html` is a prototype experience that wires the adaptive engine into a marketing-oriented UI. It is not yet packaged as a reusable toolkit.

> **New:** The demo shell now ships with the reusable `createConsentPanel` experience, downloadable compliance exports powered by `ComplianceVaultTelemetryProvider`, the remote license attestation status feed, and a commercialization coverage dashboard powered by the commercialization analytics stack. Use it to trial consent toggles, review the audit stream, monitor attestation outcomes, capture commercialization KPI snapshots, export BI feeds, and visualize pack coverage/adoption before embedding the SDK elsewhere.

## üß† Adaptive Architecture Overview

| Layer | Purpose | Key Files |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| Core Runtime | Extends the legacy `VIB34DIntegratedEngine` with adaptive hooks while preserving existing visualizers. | `src/core/AdaptiveInterfaceEngine.js` |
| Sensory Input | Normalizes gaze, neural, biometric, and ambient signals into semantic channels with schema validation. | `src/ui/adaptive/SensoryInputBridge.js`, `src/ui/adaptive/sensors/SensorSchemaRegistry.js` |
| Layout Synthesis | Generates intent-driven layout descriptors, motion cues, and color adaptation guidance using pluggable strategies/annotations. | `src/ui/adaptive/SpatialLayoutSynthesizer.js`, `src/ui/adaptive/strategies/*`, `src/ui/adaptive/annotations/*` |
| Design Language | Maps engine variations to monetizable interface patterns and integration metadata. | `src/features/DesignLanguageManager.js`, `src/ui/adaptive/InterfacePatternRegistry.js` |
| Telemetry | Classifies events, gates analytics/biometrics behind consent, enforces license activation before dispatch, routes through provider interfaces (console, HTTP, partner, compliance vault), streams audit trails into remote stores, records remote attestation/licensing events with profile-driven attestor orchestration, and now synthesizes commercialization coverage summaries with snapshot persistence/export helpers plus remote KPI storage builders. | `src/product/ProductTelemetryHarness.js`, `src/product/telemetry/*`, `src/product/licensing/LicenseManager.js`, `src/product/licensing/LicenseAttestationProfileRegistry.js`, `src/product/licensing/LicenseAttestationProfileCatalog.js`, `src/product/licensing/LicenseCommercializationReporter.js`, `src/product/licensing/LicenseCommercializationSnapshotStore.js`, `src/product/licensing/storage/CommercializationSnapshotStorageAdapters.js`, `src/product/telemetry/storage/RemoteStorageAdapters.js` |
| Licensing & Monetization | Centralizes license validation, feature gating, remote attestation, profile registries, curated attestation packs, commercialization analytics, async snapshot hydration helpers, and SDK monetization metadata for downstream integrations. | `src/product/licensing/LicenseManager.js`, `src/product/licensing/RemoteLicenseAttestor.js`, `src/product/licensing/LicenseAttestationProfileRegistry.js`, `src/product/licensing/LicenseAttestationProfileCatalog.js`, `src/product/licensing/LicenseCommercializationReporter.js`, `src/product/licensing/LicenseCommercializationSnapshotStore.js`, `src/product/licensing/storage/CommercializationSnapshotStorageAdapters.js`, `src/core/AdaptiveSDK.js`, `types/adaptive-sdk.d.ts` |
| SDK Composition | Lightweight factory for DI-based integration into partner shells (includes `createConsentPanel` helper). | `src/core/AdaptiveSDK.js` |
| Experience Shell | Demonstration UI highlighting adaptive behaviours and commercialization hooks (now composed with `createConsentPanel` and the commercialization coverage panel). | `wearable-designer.html`, `src/ui/components/ConsentPanel.js` |

- [Adaptive Engine Core Viability Assessment](DOCS/ADAPTIVE_ENGINE_CORE_ASSESSMENT.md) ‚Äì Deep-dive on whether the current stack can graduate to a commercial SDK and what refactors are required.

- [Wearable Designer Migration Checklist](PLANNING/WEARABLE_DESIGNER_MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md) ‚Äì Tasks for porting the demo shell onto the modular runtime once interfaces stabilize.

Phase 1 now delivers runtime-pluggable layout strategies, annotations, telemetry providers, sensor payload schema validation, consent-aware and license-gated telemetry, a reusable consent panel component, downloadable audit exports with remote storage adapters (retention metadata + encryption hooks), request signing middleware, a centralized license manager with remote attestation/entitlement sync, a curated license attestation profile catalog with SDK registration helpers, and a reusable license attestation profile registry surfaced through the `AdaptiveSDK` alongside the first Playwright consent/compliance smoke spec. Upcoming focus areas include wiring the smoke lane into CI, deepening hardware adapter lifecycle coverage, and porting experience shells onto the new factory. Progress on these tasks is recorded in the tracker above.

## üé® Engine Heritage

All four holographic subsystems remain available for creative workflows and continue to share the unified parameter controls described in `SYSTEM_STATUS.md`. The adaptive layer currently sits on top of this proven rendering core.

## üîß Development Notes

- The adaptive modules are delivered as native ES modules; a static HTTP server is sufficient for local prototyping.
- Legacy gallery/test harnesses remain in the repository to preserve historical functionality while refactoring proceeds.
- Automated testing for the adaptive pipeline now uses Vitest + jsdom (`npm test`). Playwright smoke suites (e.g., `npm run test:e2e:smoke`) remain optional and require a one-time `npx playwright install` to pull Chromium locally.

## üìä Reality Check

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Prototype status ‚Äì Suitable for demonstrations, not production deployments.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Documentation gap ‚Äì API contracts, adapter lifecycles, and telemetry providers still need formal specs.
- ‚úÖ Visualization core ‚Äì Legacy systems remain stable and documented (see `SYSTEM_STATUS.md`).

Contributions should reference the architecture review and tracker documents to stay aligned with the evolving roadmap.
