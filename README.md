# VIB34D Adaptive Interface Engine

VIB34D has evolved from a holographic visualization sandbox into a commercial-ready platform for designing wearable and screenless interfaces. The engine blends 4D procedural rendering with an adaptive modality stack capable of responding to gaze, neural intent, ambient context, and other emerging inputs.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start the local server (Python static host via npm script)
yarn dev

# Open the unified viewer
http://localhost:8145/index.html
```

> **Tip:** Use `DesignSystemBridge` in `src/product/DesignSystemBridge.js` to programmatically generate wearable blueprints once the viewer is running.

## 🧠 Adaptive Stack Overview
- **AdaptiveModalityManager** normalizes signals from eye tracking, neural gestures, ambient sensors, etc.
- **AdaptiveParameterBridge** synchronizes the modalities with the render loop so every system reflects the latest intent.
- **DesignSystemBridge** converts live parameters into wearable-first layout blueprints ready for export.
- **PluginRegistry** powers a marketplace of premium exporters, modality packs, and enterprise integrations.

## 🎯 Wearable & Spatial UI Focus
- **Form Factor Targeting** – Generate watch-face and spatial-disc layouts from live sensor data.
- **Gesture Semantics** – Blueprint output captures gaze dwell triggers, neural highlight intents, and ambient adaptation rules.
- **4D Visual Grammar** – Existing faceted, quantum, holographic, and polychora renderers now respond to adaptive parameters out of the box.

## 💼 Monetization & Support Hooks
- Register extensions through `PluginRegistry` with tiered pricing (`community`, `studio`, `enterprise`).
- Attach SLA metadata and telemetry to plugins using `getCommercialSummary()`.
- Package exporters for Figma, Framer, Unity, and XR toolkits as subscription add-ons.

## 📚 Documentation
- `DOCS/WEARABLE_PRODUCT_PLAN.md` – living roadmap + implementation log.
- `DOCS/WEARABLE_MODALITY_GUIDE.md` – modality taxonomy, extension recipes, and monetization strategy.
- `DOCS/4-BUSINESS-CASE.md` – updated with wearable go-to-market details (see below for summary).

## 🧪 Testing
Run the existing visual regression scripts to ensure no rendering regressions:
```bash
yarn test:visual
```

## 🌐 Roadmap Highlights
1. Launch premium exporters for major design suites.
2. Integrate biometric wearables (EEG, EMG) as first-party modalities.
3. Partner with XR headset vendors for spatial interface packs.

VIB34D is now positioned as a holistic platform for designing adaptive interfaces across wearables, ambient displays, and post-screen experiences.
