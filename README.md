# VIB34D Adaptive Interface Platform (Prototype)

The VIB34D visualization engine now includes an experimental adaptive layer aimed at wearable, ambient, and projection-first interfaces. The current codebase demonstrates the concept but still requires significant engineering work before it can be marketed as a supported SDK. Start here to understand the available pieces and how we plan to evolve them.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Concept Demo)

```bash
# Clone and navigate
cd vib34d-ultimate-viewer

# Start local server (no build tooling required)
python3 -m http.server 8080

# Open the wearable/ambient demo shell
http://localhost:8080/wearable-designer.html
```

> **Note:** `wearable-designer.html` is a prototype experience that wires the adaptive engine into a marketing-oriented UI. It is not yet packaged as a reusable toolkit.

> **New:** The demo shell now ships with the reusable `createConsentPanel` experience, downloadable compliance exports powered by `ComplianceVaultTelemetryProvider`, the remote license attestation status feed, a commercialization coverage dashboard powered by the commercialization analytics stack, an adaptive layout blueprint renderer/exporter, the blueprint insight engine that surfaces health tags plus monetizable recommendations, a calibration studio backed by the new `LayoutBlueprintCalibrationEngine`, a scenario lab that runs multi-step blueprint simulations with anomaly tagging and JSON exports, and the Evolution Lab powered by the `LayoutBlueprintEvolutionEngine` for variant sweeps and recommendation deltas. Use it to trial consent toggles, review the audit stream, monitor attestation outcomes, capture commercialization KPI snapshots, export BI feeds, visualize pack coverage/adoption, preview/download the layout blueprint health snapshot, run calibration passes on live or scenario-weighted blueprints, explore evolution variants with JSON exports, and stress-test adaptive behaviours across preset focus/ambient scenarios before embedding the SDK elsewhere.

| SDK Composition | Lightweight factory for DI-based integration into partner shells (includes `createConsentPanel` helper). | `src/core/AdaptiveSDK.js` |

| Blueprint Analytics | Builds adaptive layout blueprints, computes health metrics/status tags, tracks recommendation history, and exposes SDK helpers for partner previews. | `src/ui/adaptive/renderers/LayoutBlueprintRenderer.js`, `src/ui/adaptive/renderers/LayoutBlueprintInsightEngine.js`, `src/core/AdaptiveSDK.js`, `wearable-designer.html` |
| Scenario Simulation | Runs blueprint scenarios with step-weighted analytics, anomaly detection, and SDK-accessible history for commercialization/UX reviews. | `src/ui/adaptive/renderers/LayoutBlueprintScenarioSimulator.js`, `src/ui/adaptive/renderers/LayoutBlueprintInsightEngine.js`, `src/core/AdaptiveInterfaceEngine.js`, `src/core/AdaptiveSDK.js`, `wearable-designer.html` |
| Calibration Intelligence | Generates focus/stress/motion rebalancing plans, aggregates adjustments, records calibration history, and feeds the Calibration Studio UI. | `src/ui/adaptive/renderers/LayoutBlueprintCalibrationEngine.js`, `src/core/AdaptiveInterfaceEngine.js`, `src/core/AdaptiveSDK.js`, `wearable-designer.html` |
| Blueprint Evolution | Generates blueprint variants with analytics deltas, aggregates recommendations, and feeds the Evolution Lab experience for commercialization-ready tuning. | `src/ui/adaptive/renderers/LayoutBlueprintEvolutionEngine.js`, `src/core/AdaptiveInterfaceEngine.js`, `src/core/AdaptiveSDK.js`, `wearable-designer.html` |

Phase 1 now delivers runtime-pluggable layout strategies, annotations, telemetry providers, sensor payload schema validation, consent-aware and license-gated telemetry, a reusable consent panel component, downloadable audit exports with remote storage adapters (retention metadata + encryption hooks), request signing middleware, a centralized license manager with remote attestation/entitlement sync, a curated license attestation profile catalog with SDK registration helpers, a reusable license attestation profile registry surfaced through the `AdaptiveSDK`, the commercialization analytics bridge, blueprint analytics/insight history surfaced through the SDK plus demo UI, the blueprint scenario simulator with history exports powering the Scenario Lab, the blueprint calibration engine with SDK hooks plus a Calibration Studio for actionable adjustment plans, and the blueprint evolution engine with SDK hooks plus an Evolution Lab for variant analysis. Upcoming focus areas include wiring the smoke lane into CI, deepening hardware adapter lifecycle coverage, and porting experience shells onto the new factory. Progress on these tasks is recorded in the tracker above.

## 🎨 Engine Heritage

All four holographic subsystems remain available for creative workflows and continue to share the unified parameter controls described in `SYSTEM_STATUS.md`. The adaptive layer currently sits on top of this proven rendering core.

## 🔧 Development Notes

- The adaptive modules are delivered as native ES modules; a static HTTP server is sufficient for local prototyping.
- Legacy gallery/test harnesses remain in the repository to preserve historical functionality while refactoring proceeds.
- Automated testing for the adaptive pipeline now uses Vitest + jsdom (`npm test`). Playwright smoke suites (e.g., `npm run test:e2e:smoke`) remain optional and require a one-time `npx playwright install` to pull Chromium locally.

## 📊 Reality Check

- ⚠️ Prototype status – Suitable for demonstrations, not production deployments.
- ⚠️ Documentation gap – API contracts, adapter lifecycles, and telemetry providers still need formal specs.
- ✅ Visualization core – Legacy systems remain stable and documented (see `SYSTEM_STATUS.md`).

Contributions should reference the architecture review and tracker documents to stay aligned with the evolving roadmap.
