# Wearable Interface Productization Plan

## Vision Statement
Transform the existing VIB34D visualization engine into a commercial-grade wearable interface design platform focused on adaptive, modality-agnostic UI generation for emerging input paradigms (eye focus, neural gestures, ambient signals, etc.).

## Strategic Objectives
1. **Product Readiness** – Reframe the engine architecture to target UI/UX creation workflows and emphasize extensibility for premium tooling.
2. **Adaptive Interaction Core** – Introduce an input-modality layer capable of translating sensor data into interface-ready parameters.
3. **Commercial Ecosystem** – Provide hooks for plugins, licensing, and integrations with popular design tools.
4. **Documentation & Enablement** – Deliver clear guidance for designers, developers, and partners to adopt and extend the platform.

## Implementation Plan & Log
The table below captures every planned task and its execution status. Rows will be updated or appended as work progresses.

| Status | Area | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ Done | Architecture | Introduced adaptive modality manager translating novel inputs to engine parameters. | Implemented `AdaptiveModalityManager` + profiles. |
| ✅ Done | Architecture | Created parameter bridge aligning the render loop with adaptive inputs. | Integrated with `VIB34DUnifiedEngine`. |
| ✅ Done | Product Layer | Established plugin/extension registry scaffolding for monetization-ready ecosystem. | `PluginRegistry` now available under `src/product/`. |
| ✅ Done | Product Layer | Provided design system bridge that outputs wearable-friendly UI blueprints. | `DesignSystemBridge` enables exports. |
| ✅ Done | Documentation | Updated README with wearable-focused go-to-market overview. | Adds monetization + adaptive stack summary. |
| ✅ Done | Documentation | Documented adaptive modality taxonomy and extension guidelines. | See `DOCS/WEARABLE_MODALITY_GUIDE.md`. |
| ✅ Done | Monetization | Outlined licensing/support tiers and premium extension strategy. | Updated `DOCS/4-BUSINESS-CASE.md`. |
| ✅ Done | QA | Listed Playwright suites to confirm coverage post-refactor. | `npm test -- --list`. |
