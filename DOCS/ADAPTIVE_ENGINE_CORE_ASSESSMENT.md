# Adaptive Engine Core Viability Assessment

## 1. Session Context (2025-10-07)
- **Objective:** Validate whether the current adaptive stack can serve as the commercial core for wearable/ambient UI tooling.
- **Inputs Reviewed:** `AdaptiveInterfaceEngine`, sensory/layout modules, commercialization utilities, and the wearable designer shell.
- **Outcome:** The existing structure is a strong prototype but requires a refactor programme before being packaged as a core SDK.

## 2. Capability Fit Analysis
| Layer | Strengths | Limitations | Decision |
|-------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Core Runtime (`AdaptiveInterfaceEngine`) | Preserves legacy visualizer compatibility while introducing adaptive pipeline hooks for sensory updates.【F:src/core/AdaptiveInterfaceEngine.js†L16-L201】 | Lifecycle and variation flows are hardwired to demo hooks instead of a published API surface. | Keep, but extract public methods + TypeScript definitions during SDK boundary work (Phase 1). |
| Sensory Input (`SensoryInputBridge`) | Extensible channel registry, configurable decay, schema normalization, adapter lifecycle hooks, and snapshot export suitable for eye/neural adapters.【F:src/ui/adaptive/SensoryInputBridge.js†L10-L296】【F:src/ui/adaptive/sensors/SensorSchemaRegistry.js†L1-L230】 | Lifecycle hooks exist but need production hardening, reporting contracts, and hardware certification guidance. | Retain architecture, finalize adapter lifecycle contracts + error telemetry. |
| Layout (`SpatialLayoutSynthesizer`) | Multi-zone descriptors with chroma/motion heuristics already mapped to engine parameters.【F:src/ui/adaptive/SpatialLayoutSynthesizer.js†L18-L111】 | Monolithic heuristics make alternative strategies/testing difficult. | Split into strategy modules (zoning/motion/color) and expose injection API. |
| Commercialization (`DesignLanguageManager`, `InterfacePatternRegistry`, `ProductTelemetryHarness`, `LicenseManager`, `RemoteLicenseAttestor`, `LicenseAttestationProfileRegistry`, `LicenseAttestationProfileCatalog`, `LicenseCommercializationReporter`, `LicenseCommercializationSnapshotStore`, `CommercializationSnapshotStorageAdapters`) | Provides monetization metadata, consent-aware + license-gated telemetry, remote attestation history, curated attestation packs, commercialization analytics summaries, KPI snapshot persistence/export helpers with async hydration, remote storage builders (generic/S3), and adapter lifecycle instrumentation.【F:src/features/DesignLanguageManager.js†L18-L78】【F:src/ui/adaptive/InterfacePatternRegistry.js†L11-L87】【F:src/product/ProductTelemetryHarness.js†L7-L495】【F:src/product/licensing/LicenseManager.js†L1-L237】【F:src/product/licensing/RemoteLicenseAttestor.js†L1-L253】【F:src/product/licensing/LicenseAttestationProfileRegistry.js†L1-L172】【F:src/product/licensing/LicenseAttestationProfileCatalog.js†L1-L302】【F:src/product/licensing/LicenseCommercializationReporter.js†L1-L290】【F:src/product/licensing/LicenseCommercializationSnapshotStore.js†L1-L238】【F:src/product/licensing/storage/CommercializationSnapshotStorageAdapters.js†L1-L142】 | Telemetry still needs signed provider integrations while commercialization now requires retry/backoff policies for remote adapters and partner-facing analytics documentation. | Expand provider catalog, codify attestation SLA guidance + endpoint schema docs, benchmark the new packs, harden remote storage (retry/backoff, telemetry), and expose commercialization dashboards with partner ingestion guides. |
| Experience Shell (`wearable-designer.html`) | Demonstrates adaptive behaviour + commercialization toggles end-to-end, now including a live layout blueprint renderer/export flow layered onto the canvas stack, blueprint health tags, the Scenario Lab, Calibration Studio, and the new Evolution Lab with JSON exports.【F:wearable-designer.html†L1-L240】【F:wearable-designer.html†L557-L1080】 | Single monolithic file prevents reuse, testing, or partner integration samples despite the richer visualization/analytics. | Rebuild as modular demo kit (Phase 3). |
| Blueprint Analytics (`LayoutBlueprintRenderer`, `LayoutBlueprintInsightEngine`) | Normalizes blueprint analytics (balance, focus reliability, stress risk, motion stability), surfaces annotation overlays, tracks recommendation history, and exposes SDK helpers so partners can snapshot adaptive health without touching internals.【F:src/ui/adaptive/renderers/LayoutBlueprintRenderer.js†L1-L360】【F:src/ui/adaptive/renderers/LayoutBlueprintInsightEngine.js†L1-L220】【F:src/core/AdaptiveSDK.js†L101-L270】 | Analytics heuristics remain prototype-grade (no calibration data, no persistence outside browser memory) and insight history lives only client-side until backend ingestion lands. | Validate heuristics with wearable pilots, export insight snapshots through telemetry/commercialization channels in Phase 2. |
| Scenario Analytics (`LayoutBlueprintScenarioSimulator`) | Runs weighted, multi-step blueprint scenarios, derives aggregate confidence/peak stress metrics, records anomalies/status tags, and exposes history via `AdaptiveInterfaceEngine`/`AdaptiveSDK` for commercialization dashboards and partner tooling.【F:src/ui/adaptive/renderers/LayoutBlueprintScenarioSimulator.js†L1-L205】【F:src/core/AdaptiveInterfaceEngine.js†L280-L360】【F:src/core/AdaptiveSDK.js†L184-L246】 | Scenario heuristics/anomaly thresholds are still heuristic defaults with no retention beyond in-memory history; no telemetry export path yet. | Calibrate scenario presets with pilot data, define retention/consent posture before enabling telemetry uploads, and expose authoring APIs for partner-defined scenarios. |
| Calibration Intelligence (`LayoutBlueprintCalibrationEngine`) | Provides reusable calibrators (focus stability, stress diffusion, motion harmonics, zone balance), aggregates adjustment recommendations, captures calibration history, and feeds both the SDK and the wearable Calibration Studio for monetizable tuning workflows.【F:src/ui/adaptive/renderers/LayoutBlueprintCalibrationEngine.js†L1-L205】【F:src/core/AdaptiveInterfaceEngine.js†L320-L436】【F:src/core/AdaptiveSDK.js†L200-L310】【F:wearable-designer.html†L703-L919】 | Calibrator heuristics need validation with real sensor datasets; no telemetry/BI export exists beyond JSON downloads, and adjustment packs lack pricing/SLAs. | Validate calibrator thresholds via pilot studies, map calibration events into telemetry/commercialization channels, and formalize partner-facing adjustment pack templates. |
| Evolution Intelligence (`LayoutBlueprintEvolutionEngine`) | Suggests blueprint variants with aggregated analytics deltas, tracks evolution history, and exposes SDK helpers plus the wearable Evolution Lab so partners can evaluate adaptive experiments without rebuilding analytics stacks.【F:src/ui/adaptive/renderers/LayoutBlueprintEvolutionEngine.js†L1-L205】【F:src/core/AdaptiveInterfaceEngine.js†L320-L420】【F:src/core/AdaptiveSDK.js†L200-L255】【F:wearable-designer.html†L720-L1080】 | Variant heuristics are prototype-grade, history remains in-memory, and no telemetry/commercialization export exists beyond JSON downloads. | Validate evolution heuristics with wearable datasets, connect evolution summaries to telemetry/commercialization exports, and define partner-facing variant curation templates. |

## 3. Scalability & Elegance Gaps
1. **API Boundary Ambiguity** – Consumers must import internal modules directly; no SDK packaging, versioning, or compatibility guarantees.
2. **Data Contract Fragility** – Runtime schema validation now clamps payloads, but missing hardware lifecycle hooks and consent flows still threaten production integrations.
3. **Testing & Automation Debt** – Vitest now covers layout, sensor validation, and telemetry paths, yet Playwright smoke/visual suites remain absent pending the new automation plan.
4. **Commercialization Hardening** – Consent layer, license gating, remote attestation, remote export retention/encryption hooks, the attestation profile registry, and curated profile packs landed, but telemetry still needs signed provider integrations while partner-facing profile docs, SLA benchmarking, and monetization metadata exports require documentation/persistence for partner platforms.
5. **Scenario Calibration** – The new scenario simulator surfaces anomaly tags and aggregate KPIs, yet thresholds remain unvalidated and no retention/export policies exist. Telemetry/consent story must be aligned before streaming scenarios off-device.

## 4. Core Decision
- **Go-Forward Stance:** The prototype is a viable foundation *if and only if* we execute the refactor roadmap. A rewrite is unnecessary; strategic modularization and contract hardening will yield an SDK-grade core.
- **KPIs for Graduation:**
  - Public SDK entry point with semantic versioning and documentation.
  - Validated sensory adapter contracts (runtime schemas + adapter lifecycle tests).
  - Pluggable layout/telemetry strategies with baseline automated coverage.
  - Modular demo kit showcasing partner integration flows.

## 5. Refactor Programme Synopsis
| Phase | Focus | Key Deliverables |
|-------|-------|------------------|
| Phase 0 (now) | Planning & alignment | Updated tracker, session log, viability assessment (this doc). |
| Phase 1 | SDK boundary & contracts | Package `AdaptiveInterfaceEngine`, define adapter interfaces, add schema validation. |
| Phase 2 | Modular subsystems | Strategy modules for layout, provider pattern for telemetry, baseline Playwright smoke tests. |
| Phase 3 | Commercialization assets | Modular demo kit, partner starter templates, monetization analytics documentation. |

## 6. Immediate Next Actions
1. Wire the new Playwright smoke lane into CI with cached Chromium binaries and smoke-only triggers.
2. Publish telemetry provider configuration samples that consume `registerTelemetryRequestMiddleware` and the signing middleware helper.
3. Socialize the remote encryption templates with compliance/legal stakeholders and capture approval notes.
4. Continue session logging (see `PLANNING/SESSION_LOG.md`) to trace decisions and unblockers for commercialization milestones.
