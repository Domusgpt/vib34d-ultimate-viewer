# Adaptive Engine Core Viability Assessment

## 1. Session Context (2025-10-07)
- **Objective:** Validate whether the current adaptive stack can serve as the commercial core for wearable/ambient UI tooling.
- **Inputs Reviewed:** `AdaptiveInterfaceEngine`, sensory/layout modules, commercialization utilities, and the wearable designer shell.
- **Outcome:** The existing structure is a strong prototype but requires a refactor programme before being packaged as a core SDK.

## 2. Capability Fit Analysis
| Layer | Strengths | Limitations | Decision |
|-------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Core Runtime (`AdaptiveInterfaceEngine`) | Preserves legacy visualizer compatibility while introducing adaptive pipeline hooks for sensory updates.【F:src/core/AdaptiveInterfaceEngine.js†L16-L201】 | Lifecycle and variation flows are hardwired to demo hooks instead of a published API surface. | Keep, but extract public methods + TypeScript definitions during SDK boundary work (Phase 1). |
| Sensory Input (`SensoryInputBridge`) | Extensible channel registry, configurable decay, schema normalization, adapter lifecycle hooks, and snapshot export suitable for eye/neural adapters.【F:src/ui/adaptive/SensoryInputBridge.js†L10-L296】【F:src/ui/adaptive/sensors/SensorSchemaRegistry.js†L1-L230】 | Lifecycle hooks exist but need production hardening, reporting contracts, and hardware certification guidance. | Retain architecture, finalize adapter lifecycle contracts + error telemetry. |
| Layout (`SpatialLayoutSynthesizer`) | Multi-zone descriptors with chroma/motion heuristics already mapped to engine parameters.【F:src/ui/adaptive/SpatialLayoutSynthesizer.js†L18-L111】 | Monolithic heuristics make alternative strategies/testing difficult. | Split into strategy modules (zoning/motion/color) and expose injection API. |
| Commercialization (`DesignLanguageManager`, `InterfacePatternRegistry`, `ProductTelemetryHarness`, `LicenseAttestationAnalytics`, `LicenseManager`, `RemoteLicenseAttestor`, `LicenseAttestationProfileRegistry`, `LicenseAttestationProfileCatalog`) | Provides monetization metadata, consent-aware + license-gated telemetry, license attestation analytics with exportable reports, curated attestation packs, and adapter lifecycle instrumentation surfaced through the SDK and wearable demo.【F:src/features/DesignLanguageManager.js†L18-L78】【F:src/ui/adaptive/InterfacePatternRegistry.js†L11-L87】【F:src/product/ProductTelemetryHarness.js†L7-L676】【F:src/product/licensing/LicenseAttestationAnalytics.js†L1-L476】【F:src/product/licensing/LicenseManager.js†L1-L237】【F:src/product/licensing/RemoteLicenseAttestor.js†L1-L253】【F:src/product/licensing/LicenseAttestationProfileRegistry.js†L1-L172】【F:src/product/licensing/LicenseAttestationProfileCatalog.js†L1-L302】 | Telemetry still needs signed provider integrations while analytics outputs require partner endpoint documentation plus monetization catalog persistence. | Expand provider catalog, codify attestation SLA guidance + endpoint schema docs, benchmark the new packs + analytics, and persist monetization registries. |
| Experience Shell (`wearable-designer.html`) | Demonstrates adaptive behaviour + commercialization toggles end-to-end.【F:wearable-designer.html†L1-L255】 | Single 255-line file prevents reuse, testing, or partner integration samples. | Rebuild as modular demo kit (Phase 3). |

## 3. Scalability & Elegance Gaps
1. **API Boundary Ambiguity** – Consumers must import internal modules directly; no SDK packaging, versioning, or compatibility guarantees.
2. **Data Contract Fragility** – Runtime schema validation now clamps payloads, but missing hardware lifecycle hooks and consent flows still threaten production integrations.
3. **Testing & Automation Debt** – Vitest now covers layout, sensor validation, and telemetry paths, yet Playwright smoke/visual suites remain absent pending the new automation plan.
4. **Commercialization Hardening** – Consent layer, license gating, remote attestation, remote export retention/encryption hooks, the attestation profile registry, curated profile packs, and analytics surfaced through the harness/SDK landed, but telemetry still needs signed provider integrations while partner-facing profile docs, SLA benchmarking, analytics reporting, and monetization metadata exports require documentation/persistence for partner platforms.

## 4. Core Decision
- **Go-Forward Stance:** The prototype is a viable foundation *if and only if* we execute the refactor roadmap. A rewrite is unnecessary; strategic modularization and contract hardening will yield an SDK-grade core.
- **KPIs for Graduation:**
  - Public SDK entry point with semantic versioning and documentation.
  - Validated sensory adapter contracts (runtime schemas + adapter lifecycle tests).
  - Pluggable layout/telemetry strategies with baseline automated coverage.
  - Modular demo kit showcasing partner integration flows.

## 5. Refactor Programme Synopsis
| Phase | Focus | Key Deliverables |
|-------|-------|------------------|
| Phase 0 (now) | Planning & alignment | Updated tracker, session log, viability assessment (this doc). |
| Phase 1 | SDK boundary & contracts | Package `AdaptiveInterfaceEngine`, define adapter interfaces, add schema validation. |
| Phase 2 | Modular subsystems | Strategy modules for layout, provider pattern for telemetry, baseline Playwright smoke tests. |
| Phase 3 | Commercialization assets | Modular demo kit, partner starter templates, monetization analytics documentation. |

## 6. Immediate Next Actions
1. Wire the new Playwright smoke lane into CI with cached Chromium binaries and smoke-only triggers.
2. Publish telemetry provider configuration samples that consume `registerTelemetryRequestMiddleware` and the signing middleware helper.
3. Socialize the remote encryption templates with compliance/legal stakeholders and capture approval notes.
4. Continue session logging (see `PLANNING/SESSION_LOG.md`) to trace decisions and unblockers for commercialization milestones.
