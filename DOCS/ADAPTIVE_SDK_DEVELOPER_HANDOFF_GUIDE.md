# Adaptive SDK Developer Handoff & Publishing Guide

This guide consolidates everything a delivery or partner engineering team needs to operate, extend, and publish the Adaptive Interface SDK that now powers the wearable/projection demo experience. It is intended for internal handoff, external enablement, and commercialization packaging.

## 2. Developer Handoff Checklist

The following steps must be completed before a new team assumes ownership or before distributing a partner preview build:

1. **Environment Readiness**
   - Run `npm install` and confirm `npm test` passes (Vitest suites).
   - Optional: install Playwright browsers (`npx playwright install`) if e2e smoke specs are required.
   - Verify local HTTP server access (`python3 -m http.server 8080`) renders `wearable-designer.html` with no console errors.

2. **License & Consent Configuration**
   - Provision `LicenseManager` with initial license payloads (`setLicense`, `validateLicense`) and connect attestation profiles via `registerAttestationProfile` or catalog packs.
   - Configure consent defaults through `createConsentPanel` options and confirm telemetry events are gated until consent toggles are enabled.

3. **Telemetry Providers & Middleware**
   - Register required providers (`ConsoleTelemetryProvider`, `HttpTelemetryProvider`, `PartnerTelemetryProvider`, `ComplianceVaultTelemetryProvider`).
   - Attach middleware (e.g., `createRequestSigningMiddleware`) and remote storage adapters per deployment environment.
   - Capture audit trails via `getTelemetryAuditTrail()` and remote vault exports.

4. **Adaptive Layout & Projection Integration**
   - Choose default layout strategies/annotations and verify blueprint exports using `buildLayoutBlueprint()`.
   - Hydrate projection scenario catalog entries, validate them through the validator summaries, and simulate key scenarios in the projection composer.

5. **Commercialization Analytics**
   - Configure `LicenseCommercializationReporter` listeners, schedule snapshot captures, and connect remote storage adapters (`createSignedS3SnapshotAdapter`, etc.).
   - Export JSON/CSV snapshots and ensure KPI deltas populate commercialization dashboards in the demo shell.

6. **Security & Compliance**
   - Apply encryption templates from `REMOTE_STORAGE_ENCRYPTION_TEMPLATES.md` to remote storage adapters.
   - Document retention policies, data minimization settings, and consent audit expectations for each telemetry channel.

7. **Documentation & Support Links**
   - Review README updates, roadmap references, and ensure partner-facing materials include this guide plus SDK boundary documentation.
   - Update `PLANNING/SESSION_LOG.md` with ownership transition details and next steps.

## 3. SDK Publishing Workflow

1. **Versioning & Change Control**
   - Maintain semantic version tags aligned with SDK surface changes; document breaking changes in `DOCS/SDK_BOUNDARY_PROPOSAL.md` changelog section.
   - Require green Vitest + Playwright smoke suites before tagging.

2. **Packaging**
   - Bundle runtime modules as ES modules (no transpilation required) and ship TypeScript definitions from `types/adaptive-sdk.d.ts`.
   - Include consent panel styles/scripts for white-label embedding or provide integration guidance referencing `wearable-designer.html`.

3. **Artifact Distribution**
   - Publish npm package (private feed or public) with `/src/core`, `/src/product`, `/src/ui/adaptive`, `/types`, and `/DOCS` references.
   - Provide partner ZIP bundle containing demo shell (`wearable-designer.html`), commercialization dashboards, and projection assets for evaluation.

4. **Release Documentation**
   - Attach this handoff guide, the Telemetry Privacy & Consent Guide, License Attestation Profile Catalog, and Commercialization Analytics Bridge to release notes.
   - Capture migration notes (if any) in `PLANNING/WEARABLE_DESIGNER_MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md` and mark completion in the tracker.

5. **Support & SLA Alignment**
   - Confirm attestation profiles (enterprise/studio/indie) match contractual SLAs; update catalog defaults as needed.
   - Log support contacts, escalation paths, and partner enablement sessions inside the tracker.

## 4. QA & Validation Matrix

| Area | Primary Tests | Owner |
|------|---------------|-------|
| Unit Coverage | `npm test` (Vitest suites across layout, telemetry, licensing, projection, commercialization) | Core Team |
| E2E Smoke | `npm run test:e2e:smoke` (consent & compliance Playwright spec) | Experience QA |
| Manual Demo Validation | Execute `wearable-designer.html` walkthrough covering consent toggles, compliance exports, blueprint download, projection simulations, commercialization snapshots. | Product Ops |
| Security Review | Apply encryption templates, verify request signing middleware, audit telemetry classifications. | Security Liaison |
| Licensing Scenarios | Validate license activation/revocation flows via `RemoteLicenseAttestor` and catalog packs. | Monetization Lead |

## 5. Handoff Expectations

- **Transition Briefing:** Outgoing team must review this guide with incoming leads, highlighting open backlog items (see tracker) and unresolved risks.
- **Documentation Updates:** Every major change to runtime modules must append notes to this guide and relevant deep-dive docs.
- **Partner Enablement:** Provide SDK onboarding workshops using the wearable designer shell plus blueprint/projection exports as demo collateral.
- **Feedback Loop:** Capture partner feedback in `PLANNING/SESSION_LOG.md` and translate into backlog items (B-series) for prioritization.
