# Adaptive Engine Architecture Review

## Purpose
This document captures a ground-truth assessment of the adaptive VIB34D code introduced in the previous refactor. It records what currently exists, how it is wired together, and whether the implementation is suitable as a commercial core for extensible wearable/ambient UI design.

## 1. Current System Inventory
### 1.1 Core Runtime Layer
- `src/core/AdaptiveInterfaceEngine.js` extends the historical `VIB34DIntegratedEngine` and owns the adaptive pipeline (sensory bridge → layout synthesizer → parameter writes).【F:src/core/AdaptiveInterfaceEngine.js†L1-L95】
- The base holographic subsystems (FACETED/QUANTUM/HOLOGRAPHIC/POLYCHORA) remain intact under `src/` and are still parameter-driven via the shared `parameterManager` foundation documented in `SYSTEM_STATUS.md`.【F:SYSTEM_STATUS.md†L59-L129】

### 1.2 Adaptive Input & Layout Layer
- `src/ui/adaptive/SensoryInputBridge.js` normalizes intent, biometric, ambient, and gesture events with configurable decay and subscription hooks.【F:src/ui/adaptive/SensoryInputBridge.js†L10-L248】
- `src/ui/adaptive/SpatialLayoutSynthesizer.js` converts the sensory snapshot into multi-zone layout descriptors, typography guidance, and motion cues.【F:src/ui/adaptive/SpatialLayoutSynthesizer.js†L1-L124】
- `src/ui/adaptive/InterfacePatternRegistry.js` catalogs monetizable UI patterns and exposes filtering/export APIs.【F:src/ui/adaptive/InterfacePatternRegistry.js†L1-L87】

### 1.3 Commercialization Layer
- `src/features/DesignLanguageManager.js` maps variation names to registry patterns, generates monetization/integration descriptors, and controls the active "design language" mode.【F:src/features/DesignLanguageManager.js†L1-L80】
- `src/product/ProductTelemetryHarness.js` classifies events, enforces consent gates, records audit logs, and buffers telemetry for provider dispatch.【F:src/product/ProductTelemetryHarness.js†L1-L192】

### 1.4 Experience Layer
- `wearable-designer.html` (255 lines) acts as the showcase shell that instantiates `AdaptiveInterfaceEngine`, renders marketing UI, and exposes monetization toggles. The file is large, tightly coupled, and currently lacks modular structure for reuse.

## 2. Architectural Strengths
1. **Separation of concerns** – Sensory normalization, layout synthesis, design language mapping, and telemetry are isolated classes with single responsibilities.【F:src/ui/adaptive/SensoryInputBridge.js†L10-L248】【F:src/ui/adaptive/SpatialLayoutSynthesizer.js†L1-L124】
2. **Non-breaking integration** – `AdaptiveInterfaceEngine` still relies on the historical parameter manager so legacy visualizers continue to function.【F:src/core/AdaptiveInterfaceEngine.js†L40-L71】
3. **Commercial hooks present** – Design-language metadata and telemetry harness outline viable monetization paths, fulfilling the productization brief.【F:src/features/DesignLanguageManager.js†L36-L67】【F:src/product/ProductTelemetryHarness.js†L1-L71】

## 3. Critical Gaps & Risks
1. **Instantiation coupling** – Only the bespoke `wearable-designer.html` consumes the adaptive engine. No modular entry point exists for reuse across apps, making it hard to sell as a SDK.
2. **Input validation maturity** – New `SensorSchemaRegistry` clamps and normalizes gaze/neural/biometric payloads, but hardware-specific adapters, consent prompts, and type definitions are still missing for production wearables.【F:src/ui/adaptive/SensoryInputBridge.js†L10-L248】【F:src/ui/adaptive/sensors/SensorSchemaRegistry.js†L1-L218】
3. **Monolithic layout logic** – `SpatialLayoutSynthesizer` blends heuristics, presets, and annotation emission in a single class, complicating testability and alternative layout strategies.【F:src/ui/adaptive/SpatialLayoutSynthesizer.js†L9-L111】
4. **Telemetry abstraction still maturing** – The harness now supports consent gating and audit trails but still lacks hardened batching, auth signing, and partner-specific privacy exports required by enterprise clients.【F:src/product/ProductTelemetryHarness.js†L1-L192】
5. **Documentation drift** – Marketing-heavy README and plan documents claim full product readiness, while there is no engineering validation, API reference, or integration samples beyond the demo shell.【F:README.md†L1-L53】【F:DOCS/ADAPTIVE_UI_PRODUCT_PLAN.md†L1-L40】

## 4. Suitability as Commercial Core
- **Short term:** The adaptive stack can power exploratory demos and concept pitches thanks to the isolated modules, new sensor schema validation, and compatibility with the existing visualization engine. Remaining risks involve SDK packaging, telemetry privacy, and end-to-end hardware validation.
- **Long term:** Without a refactor focused on interface contracts, plugin architecture, and modular packaging, the current code will not scale. It risks becoming another bespoke demo rather than a reusable platform.

## 5. Recommended Refactor Themes
1. **SDK Boundary Definition** – Extract a framework-neutral package (`packages/adaptive-core`) exposing `AdaptiveInterfaceEngine`, sensor adapter interfaces, and TypeScript definitions.
2. **Input Contract Hardening** – Extend the new schema validation layer with TypeScript definitions, consent workflows, and adapter lifecycle hooks (connect/disconnect/test) for real sensor hardware.
3. **Layout Strategy Pipeline** – Split `SpatialLayoutSynthesizer` into strategy modules (zoning, motion, chroma) and allow dependency injection for alternative heuristics.
4. **Telemetry Provider Interface** – Expand the provider catalog (Segment, Mixpanel), add signed requests/encryption, and formalize consent export APIs on top of the new classification/audit layer.
5. **Experience Layer Modularization** – Rebuild `wearable-designer.html` as a composable UI kit (e.g., Web Components or React wrapper) with smaller example scenes.

## 6. Next Steps Snapshot
- Phase 0 (Now): Create engineering roadmap & tracking system, align documentation with reality.
- Phase 1: Carve out SDK boundary, formalize schema registration workflows, and codify telemetry privacy guardrails.
- Phase 2: Modularize layout/telemetry subsystems and add automated tests.
- Phase 3: Produce integration samples and extension templates for tooling partners.
