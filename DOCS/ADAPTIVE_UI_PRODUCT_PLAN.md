# Adaptive UI Productization Plan

## Vision
Transform the existing VIB34D holographic engine into a commercial-grade adaptive interface design platform targeted at future-facing wearable and ambient devices. The product will enable designers to prototype and deploy 4D-projection-inspired user interfaces that respond to non-traditional inputs such as eye focus, neural gestures, biometric signals, and spatial gestures.

## Strategic Objectives
1. **Product Repositioning** – Reframe the core engine as a UI/UX prototyping suite instead of a gallery-only renderer.
2. **Adaptive Input Layer** – Introduce abstractions for sensor-driven inputs (eye tracking, neural intent, biometric feedback, ambient context).
3. **UI Component Language** – Replace variation-only focus with reusable UI schema modules that map to wearable experience patterns.
4. **Design Workflow Integration** – Prepare extension points for Figma, Framer, Webflow, and custom plugin ecosystems.
5. **Monetization Foundations** – Provide subscription hooks, analytics, and licensing toggles for enterprise support.
6. **Documentation & Support** – Deliver comprehensive docs, roadmap, and onboarding artifacts.

## Work Breakdown Structure
- [x] Create adaptive input bridge module (sensor abstraction).
- [x] Build responsive layout synthesizer for non-screen surfaces.
- [x] Extend variation manager into design pattern registry.
- [x] Add commercialization hooks (licensing, telemetry, modular add-ons).
- [x] Produce new HTML entry point showcasing wearable/adaptive UI workflow.
- [x] Update README and craft go-to-market documentation.
- [x] Outline partner & plugin integration strategy.
