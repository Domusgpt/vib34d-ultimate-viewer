# Adaptive UI Productization Plan

## Vision
Transform the existing VIB34D holographic engine into a commercial-grade adaptive interface design platform targeted at future-facing wearable and ambient devices. The product will enable designers to prototype and deploy 4D-projection-inspired user interfaces that respond to non-traditional inputs such as eye focus, neural gestures, biometric signals, and spatial gestures.

## Strategic Objectives
1. **Product Repositioning** – Reframe the core engine as a UI/UX prototyping suite instead of a gallery-only renderer.
2. **Adaptive Input Layer** – Introduce abstractions for sensor-driven inputs (eye tracking, neural intent, biometric feedback, ambient context).
3. **UI Component Language** – Replace variation-only focus with reusable UI schema modules that map to wearable experience patterns.
4. **Design Workflow Integration** – Prepare extension points for Figma, Framer, Webflow, and custom plugin ecosystems.
5. **Monetization Foundations** – Provide subscription hooks, analytics, and licensing toggles for enterprise support.
6. **Documentation & Support** – Deliver comprehensive docs, roadmap, and onboarding artifacts.

## Work Breakdown Structure
- [x] Create adaptive input bridge module (sensor abstraction).
- [x] Build responsive layout synthesizer for non-screen surfaces.
- [x] Extend variation manager into design pattern registry.
- [x] Add commercialization hooks (licensing, telemetry, modular add-ons).
- [x] Produce new HTML entry point showcasing wearable/adaptive UI workflow.
- [x] Update README and craft go-to-market documentation.
- [x] Outline partner & plugin integration strategy.

## Implementation Log
This section will be filled while executing the plan to provide transparent, time-ordered documentation of every change.

- ✅ **Initialized documentation** – Captured vision, objectives, and work breakdown for adaptive UI productization.
- ✅ **Created SensoryInputBridge** – Added `src/ui/adaptive/SensoryInputBridge.js` to normalize multi-modal sensor data for wearable interfaces.
- ✅ **Added SpatialLayoutSynthesizer** – Introduced `src/ui/adaptive/SpatialLayoutSynthesizer.js` to translate adaptive signals into wearable-friendly layout descriptors.
- ✅ **Established InterfacePatternRegistry** – Added `src/ui/adaptive/InterfacePatternRegistry.js` to catalogue monetizable adaptive UI blueprints.
- ✅ **Bound geometry to design** – Implemented `src/features/DesignLanguageManager.js` to map holographic variations to sellable UI languages.
- ✅ **Productized core engine** – Created `src/core/AdaptiveInterfaceEngine.js` with sensory-driven layout synthesis and telemetry hooks.
- ✅ **Telemetry foundation** – Added `src/product/ProductTelemetryHarness.js` for licensing-aware analytics.
- ✅ **Consent & lifecycle upgrade** – Extended telemetry with consent classifications/audit trails and added sensor adapter lifecycle hooks documented in `DOCS/TELEMETRY_PRIVACY_AND_CONSENT_GUIDE.md`.
- ✅ **Wearable designer experience** – Authored `wearable-designer.html` showcasing adaptive UI workflow and commercial hooks.
- ✅ **Updated README** – Reframed project messaging around adaptive wearable UI productization.
- ✅ **Partner strategy** – Documented plugin ecosystems and monetization roadmap in `DOCS/PARTNER_INTEGRATION_STRATEGY.md`.
- ✅ **License attestation profiles** – Added `src/product/licensing/LicenseAttestationProfileRegistry.js` plus SDK/telemetry wiring so commercialization teams can package partner-specific validation endpoints and SLAs.
- ✅ **Attestation profile catalog** – Shipped `src/product/licensing/LicenseAttestationProfileCatalog.js` and `DOCS/LICENSE_ATTESTATION_PROFILE_CATALOG.md` with enterprise/studio/indie packs, SDK registration helpers, and audit coverage so monetization teams can onboard partners without hand-coding attestation configs.
- ✅ **Commercialization analytics bridge** – Added `src/product/licensing/LicenseCommercializationReporter.js`, exposed summary APIs through the telemetry harness/SDK, updated `wearable-designer.html` with a commercialization coverage panel, and refreshed documentation so partner dashboards can visualize attestation pack adoption and SLA health.
- ✅ **Commercialization KPI persistence** – Landed `LicenseCommercializationSnapshotStore`, wired snapshot capture/scheduling + exports through the telemetry harness/SDK, upgraded the wearable demo with snapshot controls/export downloads, and documented the new KPI workflow for partners.【F:src/product/licensing/LicenseCommercializationSnapshotStore.js†L1-L214】【F:src/product/ProductTelemetryHarness.js†L35-L168】【F:wearable-designer.html†L318-L474】【F:DOCS/LICENSE_COMMERCIALIZATION_ANALYTICS.md†L1-L51】
- ✅ **Adaptive blueprint renderer** – Implemented `src/ui/adaptive/renderers/LayoutBlueprintRenderer.js`, extended the wearable designer with blueprint metrics/export controls, and exposed SDK type definitions/tests so partners can preview adaptive surfaces without reverse-engineering the layout payloads.【F:src/ui/adaptive/renderers/LayoutBlueprintRenderer.js†L1-L314】【F:wearable-designer.html†L520-L620】【F:tests/vitest/layout-blueprint-renderer.test.js†L1-L84】【F:types/adaptive-sdk.d.ts†L600-L676】
- ✅ **Projection field composer & simulator** – Added `src/ui/adaptive/renderers/ProjectionFieldComposer.js` and `src/ui/adaptive/simulators/ProjectionScenarioSimulator.js`, wired the wearable designer with a 4D projection panel + scenario controls, surfaced SDK helpers/types, and documented/tests to help partners visualize halo depth, gesture contours, and licensing-friendly playback flows alongside the blueprint export.【F:src/ui/adaptive/renderers/ProjectionFieldComposer.js†L1-L273】【F:src/ui/adaptive/simulators/ProjectionScenarioSimulator.js†L1-L178】【F:wearable-designer.html†L520-L760】【F:tests/vitest/projection-field-composer.test.js†L1-L36】【F:tests/vitest/projection-scenario-simulator.test.js†L1-L54】【F:types/adaptive-sdk.d.ts†L700-L886】
- ✅ **Projection scenario catalog & packs** – Introduced `src/ui/adaptive/simulators/ProjectionScenarioCatalog.js`, default wearable-ready packs, SDK accessors, and demo wiring so projection panels hydrate automatically, partners can register bespoke packs, and tests/types document the new commercialization-friendly surface.【F:src/ui/adaptive/simulators/ProjectionScenarioCatalog.js†L1-L207】【F:src/core/AdaptiveInterfaceEngine.js†L1-L360】【F:src/core/AdaptiveSDK.js†L150-L320】【F:wearable-designer.html†L840-L1142】【F:tests/vitest/projection-scenario-catalog.test.js†L1-L61】【F:types/adaptive-sdk.d.ts†L560-L940】
