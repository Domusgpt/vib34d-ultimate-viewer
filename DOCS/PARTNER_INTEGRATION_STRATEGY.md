# Partner & Plugin Integration Strategy

## Target Ecosystems
- **Figma** – Primary design plugin delivering adaptive component previews and intent-driven variants.
- **Framer** – Real-time prototyping integration enabling neural/gesture simulation controls.
- **Webflow** – Code export and hosted telemetry integration for adaptive websites.
- **Unity / Unreal** – Wearable companion apps and holographic installations.

## Integration Layers
1. **Design Tokens API** – Surface color/motion tokens from `DesignLanguageManager` via REST or local bridge.
2. **Pattern Catalog Sync** – Use `AdaptiveInterfaceEngine.exportMarketplaceCatalog()` to populate plugin storefronts.
3. **Telemetry Webhooks** – Forward `ProductTelemetryHarness` buffers to partner analytics endpoints for shared insights.
4. **Sensor Simulation Kits** – Bundle `SensoryInputBridge` adapters that emulate gaze, EEG, and biometrics inside each tool.
5. **License Attestation Profiles** – Distribute curated `LicenseAttestationProfileRegistry` packs with endpoint URLs, headers, and SLA metadata aligned to partner support tiers.

## Commercial Opportunities
- Tiered subscriptions aligned with pattern tiers (Starter, Pro, Enterprise).
- Revenue share with platform marketplaces for premium holographic UI packs.
- Enterprise support contracts bundling integration assistance and custom pattern creation.

## Roadmap Highlights
- Q1: Deliver Figma plugin alpha with adaptive preview controls.
- Q2: Launch marketplace-ready pattern packs with licensing telemetry enabled.
- Q3: Expand to neural hardware OEM SDK partnership leveraging SensoryInputBridge adapters.

## Support Structure
- Dedicated partner portal referencing `wearable-designer.html` demo flows.
- API documentation generated from `DOCS/ADAPTIVE_UI_PRODUCT_PLAN.md` milestones.
- Community Discord & knowledge base for indie creators.
