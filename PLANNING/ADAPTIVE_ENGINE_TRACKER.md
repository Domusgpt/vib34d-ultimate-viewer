# Adaptive Engine Development Tracker

This tracker translates the architecture review into actionable engineering work. Update it with every change to maintain transparency and ensure we stay aligned with commercialization goals.

## How to Use
1. **Capture work items** in the Backlog with clear acceptance criteria.
2. **Promote items** into the Current Sprint when actively working on them and log daily notes.
3. **Close items** in the Completed section with links to commits/PRs and recorded learnings.
4. **Review blockers** during async/weekly check-ins and document decisions here.

## Environment & Tooling Checklist
- [x] Node.js dependencies installed via `npm install` (Playwright for browser automation).【3edf52†L1-L5】
- [x] Vitest + jsdom stack configured for Phase 1 unit coverage. *(Configured 2025-10-09 with `vitest.config.js` + baseline layout/telemetry tests.)*
- [ ] Playwright browsers installed (`npx playwright install`). *(Remains optional until Vitest baseline is stable or CI image includes OS deps.)*
- [x] Python3 available for static server (`python3 -m http.server`).
- [ ] Optional: Add `zod` and `typescript` once schema validation and type definitions are prioritized.

## Blockers & Risks
- **Documentation credibility:** Marketing-heavy messaging conflicts with current engineering readiness. Resolving S0-03 is critical for stakeholder trust.
- **Strategy validation:** Partner-specific layout strategy packs still need authoring and validation against real wearable surfaces.
- **Environment footprint:** Playwright OS dependencies exceed lightweight container limits. Chromium-only smoke spec exists; next up is wiring cache + smoke lane into CI.
- **Telemetry/privacy follow-up:** Consent gating exists, but signed provider integrations and long-term audit storage policies still need definition (focus shifts to B-01 follow-ups, remote adapter hardening, and license attestation under B-13).
- **Blueprint insight retention:** Insight metrics and scenario histories remain local to the wearable demo; need partner-approved storage/consent handling before syncing blueprint health or scenario KPIs to commercialization telemetry.
- **License validation maturity:** Remote attestation, revocation checks, entitlement sync, and curated attestation packs now exist; remaining work focuses on partner-specific pack expansion, SLA benchmarking, and support tooling.
- **Commercialization analytics persistence:** Remote storage adapters and async hydration shipped; next step is layering retries/backoff and connecting scheduled KPI jobs to downstream partner BI pipelines.
- **Dependency security:** `npm install` reports four moderate vulnerabilities; schedule audit once SDK packaging stabilizes.

## Next Review
- **Owner:** Core Team Lead
- **Date:** 2025-10-20
- **Agenda:** Verify Playwright smoke lane wiring in CI, lock SDK boundary acceptance criteria (B-01) around request middleware, and secure sign-off on the new encryption template roadmap for remote adapters.
