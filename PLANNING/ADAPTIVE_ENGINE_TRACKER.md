# Adaptive Engine Development Tracker

This tracker translates the architecture review into actionable engineering work. Update it with every change to maintain transparency and ensure we stay aligned with commercialization goals.

## How to Use
1. **Capture work items** in the Backlog with clear acceptance criteria.
2. **Promote items** into the Current Sprint when actively working on them and log daily notes.
3. **Close items** in the Completed section with links to commits/PRs and recorded learnings.
4. **Review blockers** during async/weekly check-ins and document decisions here.

## Environment & Tooling Checklist
- [x] Node.js dependencies installed via `npm install` (Playwright for browser automation).【3edf52†L1-L5】
- [ ] Playwright browsers installed (`npx playwright install`). *(Blocked 2025-10-07 pending resolution of `npx playwright install-deps` footprint >500 MB; evaluating lighter test stack.)*
- [x] Python3 available for static server (`python3 -m http.server`).
- [ ] Optional: Add `zod` and `typescript` once schema validation and type definitions are prioritized.

## Backlog
| ID | Title | Description | Owner | Status | Target Milestone |
|----|-------|-------------|-------|--------|------------------|
| B-01 | Define SDK boundary | Design the public API surface for `AdaptiveInterfaceEngine`, sensor adapters, and telemetry providers. | Core Team | Planned | Phase 1 |
| B-02 | Sensor schema validation | Introduce runtime schemas (likely Zod) and adapters for gaze, neural, biometrics, ambient inputs. | Core Team | Planned | Phase 1 |
| B-03 | Layout strategy modularization | Break the monolithic `SpatialLayoutSynthesizer` into interchangeable strategies with tests. | Core Team | Planned | Phase 2 |
| B-04 | Telemetry provider interface | Implement provider pattern + privacy controls to replace `ProductTelemetryHarness`'s console fallback. | Core Team | Planned | Phase 2 |
| B-05 | Demo shell modularization | Rebuild `wearable-designer.html` as documented UI components and integration samples. | Experience Team | Planned | Phase 3 |
| B-06 | Partner integration starter kits | Create Figma/Webflow plugin scaffolds referencing the SDK boundary. | Platform Team | Planned | Phase 3 |
| B-07 | Environment automation plan | Decide on lightweight browser automation stack or pre-baked Playwright image to unblock CI. | Core Team | Planned | Phase 1 |
| B-08 | Layout/telemetry modularization brief | Capture target module structure + acceptance for strategy/provider refactor. | Core Team | Planned | Phase 2 |

## Current Sprint (Phase 0)
| ID | Task | Acceptance Criteria | Status | Notes |
|----|------|---------------------|--------|-------|
| S0-01 | Document architecture baseline | Architecture review published with current inventory, risk analysis, and refactor themes. | ✅ Done | See `DOCS/ADAPTIVE_ENGINE_ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md`. |
| S0-02 | Stand up development tracker | Central tracker document (this file) with backlog, sprint view, and environment checklist. | ✅ Done | Initial backlog seeded from architecture review recommendations. |
| S0-03 | Align README with reality | Update README messaging to distinguish between demo capabilities and planned SDK roadmap. | ✅ Done | README updated in Phase 0 baseline; keep monitoring for drift. |
| S0-04 | Core viability assessment | Produce deep-dive evaluation on suitability of current stack as commercial core. | ✅ Done | See `DOCS/ADAPTIVE_ENGINE_CORE_ASSESSMENT.md`. |
| S0-05 | Environment readiness audit | Run dependency sync, document blockers, and log next steps. | ⏳ In Progress | Node modules synced; Playwright OS deps blocked (see checklist note). |

## Completed Log
| Date | Item | Outcome | Follow-ups |
|------|------|---------|------------|
| 2025-01-25 | S0-01 | Architecture review delivered and checked into repository. | Feed tasks into backlog items B-01..B-05. |
| 2025-01-25 | S0-02 | Development tracker established with environment checklist and backlog. | Maintain as source of truth for prioritization. |
| 2025-10-07 | S0-03 | README alignment verified; messaging matches prototype reality. | Monitor marketing collateral for scope creep. |
| 2025-10-07 | S0-04 | Core viability assessment published for stakeholder review. | Feed recommendations into Phase 1/2 planning docs. |

## Blockers & Risks
- **Documentation credibility:** Marketing-heavy messaging conflicts with current engineering readiness. Resolving S0-03 is critical for stakeholder trust.
- **Testing debt:** No automated coverage for the adaptive pipeline exists; we must budget time in Phase 1/2 for Playwright or Vitest coverage once schemas land.
- **Environment footprint:** Playwright OS dependencies exceed lightweight container limits. Need decision on slimmer tooling or pre-baked images before enabling CI automation.

## Next Review
- **Owner:** Core Team Lead
- **Date:** 2025-10-14
- **Agenda:** Resolve environment automation strategy (B-07), lock SDK boundary acceptance criteria (B-01), and confirm authorship plan for modularization brief (B-08).
