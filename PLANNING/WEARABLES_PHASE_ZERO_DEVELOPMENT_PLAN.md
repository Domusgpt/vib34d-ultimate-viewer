# Wearables Development – Phase Zero Execution Plan

This plan establishes the concrete engineering path for taking the adaptive VIB34D wearables stack from Phase 0 (prototype) into sustained development. It scopes only the **wearables runtime and hardware integration lane**—the UI/web experience team will operate a parallel track and consume the telemetry/licensing foundations already delivered in this repository.

## 1. Current Baseline

- Adaptive runtime, telemetry, licensing, commercialization analytics, and projection/blueprint tooling already exist inside the SDK surface (`src/core`, `src/product`, `src/ui/adaptive`).
- `wearable-designer.html` remains a monolithic demo shell demonstrating the features but is not yet modular or hardware-backed.
- Telemetry, consent, licensing attestation, commercialization snapshotting, and projection scenario infrastructure are implemented and validated through Vitest + Playwright smoke coverage.
- No production-grade wearable device adapters, schema-enforced sensor payload bridges, or deployment automation for wearable firmware/app containers exist.

## 2. Phase Zero Objectives & Exit Criteria

| Objective | Description | Exit Criteria |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Establish Wearable Device Integration Foundations | Deliver reference adapters, schema validation, and telemetry routing for real sensor inputs. | Sensor schema registry covers real device payloads, adapters stream data into `SensoryInputBridge`, hardware smoke tests execute on CI rig. |
| Modularize Wearable Runtime Package | Decouple the adaptive engine usage from the demo shell and expose reusable modules for firmware/app integrators. | `AdaptiveSDK` publishes wearable presets, modular samples replace demo wiring, API surface documented in `types/adaptive-sdk.d.ts`. |
| Align with Telemetry/Licensing Track | Ensure wearables lane consumes and exercises telemetry, consent, licensing, commercialization flows owned by the web/UI team. | Shared acceptance tests confirm telemetry gating/licensing attestation triggered from hardware adapters; audit/compliance exports include wearable-origin metadata. |
| Delivery Governance | Lock sprint cadence, tooling, and automation so Phase 1+ can scale. | Phase Zero completion review, tracker entries updated, automated smoke lane for hardware registered in CI. |

Phase Zero concludes once real wearable signals hydrate the adaptive engine end-to-end (including telemetry/licensing flows), modular runtime packages ship with documentation, and repeatable automation validates integrations.

## 3. Workstreams & Tasks

### 3.1 Hardware & Sensor Integration

1. **Device Inventory & Payload Mapping**
   - Catalogue initial wearable targets (AR visor, neural band, biometric wrist device).
   - Extract data formats, sampling rates, consent requirements.
   - Update `SensorSchemaRegistry` with concrete schema definitions and tolerance ranges.
2. **Adapter Development**
   - Implement `src/ui/adaptive/sensors/adapters/<device>.js` for each device with normalization logic feeding `SensoryInputBridge`.
   - Provide mock adapter implementations for local development and automated tests.
3. **Hardware Smoke Bench**
   - Script Playwright/Vitest-compatible harness to replay recorded sensor streams.
   - Automate on-device smoke test recipe (e.g., Node bridge + WebSocket feed) to validate integration before firmware drops.
4. **Telemetry Hook-Up**
   - Ensure adapters flag telemetry classifications via `ProductTelemetryHarness`.
   - Confirm licensing profiles (e.g., `wearables-pro`, `wearables-enterprise`) gate sensor activation.

### 3.2 Adaptive Runtime Hardening

1. **Runtime Profiles**
   - Package wearable presets inside `AdaptiveSDK` (synthesizer strategies, annotations, projection packs).
   - Document DI entry points for firmware/app teams.
2. **Blueprint & Projection Validation**
   - Add automated checks ensuring `LayoutBlueprintRenderer` and `ProjectionFieldComposer` operate within hardware constraints (FOV, refresh windows, energy budgets).
   - Extend validator outputs with device-specific warnings.
3. **Commercialization Touchpoints**
   - Preconfigure commercialization snapshot/store adapters for wearable SKUs.
   - Verify commercialization KPIs remain accurate when signals originate from hardware adapters.

### 3.3 Packaging & Distribution

1. **Module Extraction**
   - Break down `wearable-designer.html` dependencies into reusable modules (awaiting B-05 but begin with runtime packaging).
   - Publish reference implementations under `packages/wearables-kit` (or similar) with bundler config, typings, and quickstart README.
2. **Firmware/Companion App SDK**
   - Provide minimal Node/TypeScript wrapper for wearable firmware teams to embed adaptive runtime via WebView or native bridge.
   - Document telemetry/licensing handshake requirements for companion apps.
3. **Release Automation**
   - Set up semantic versioning, changelog generation, and artifact publishing (internal registry) for wearables kit.

### 3.4 Governance & Collaboration

1. **Phase Zero Sprints**
   - Sprint 0: Inventory + schema updates, finalize adapter scaffolding.
   - Sprint 1: Implement first hardware adapter + mock harness; integrate telemetry/licensing flows.
   - Sprint 2: Runtime presets, commercialization validation, documentation draft.
   - Sprint 3: Packaging, release automation, cross-track demo review.
2. **Cross-Track Agreements**
   - Weekly sync with UI/web track to share telemetry/licensing API changes.
   - Shared definition of done referencing compliance exports and commercialization dashboards.
3. **Documentation Deliverables**
   - Update `DOCS/ADAPTIVE_SDK_DEVELOPER_HANDOFF_GUIDE.md` with wearable hardware lane.
   - Produce hardware integration cookbook (per device) and troubleshooting FAQ.

## 4. Dependencies & Interfaces

- **Telemetry/Licensing:** Consume existing providers (`ProductTelemetryHarness`, `LicenseManager`, `LicenseAttestationProfileRegistry`). Hardware adapters must emit consent state and licensing context; UI/web track owns dashboards/export visualization.
- **Testing Stack:** Reuse Vitest for unit coverage, Playwright for consent/licensing flows, extend to include sensor stream replays. Consider integrating hardware lab harness via GitHub Actions self-hosted runner.
- **Types & SDK Surface:** Continue expanding `types/adaptive-sdk.d.ts` for new adapter interfaces; ensure module packaging emits types for firmware teams.

## 5. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Hardware availability delays | Blocks adapter validation and telemetry handshake. | Maintain recorded sensor traces; use emulators until devices arrive; schedule early vendor engagement. |
| Drift between wearables kit and UI/web telemetry contract | Broken dashboards, inconsistent compliance exports. | Shared schema contract repo; automated contract tests run across both tracks. |
| Performance constraints on low-power devices | Latency in adaptive layout/projection rendering. | Profile runtime on reference hardware; expose configuration knobs for throttling strategies; implement watchdog telemetry to flag overruns. |
| Licensing/attestation mismatches | Sensor activation blocked or untracked monetization usage. | Pre-register wearables profiles in catalog; add integration tests for attestation flows triggered via adapters. |
