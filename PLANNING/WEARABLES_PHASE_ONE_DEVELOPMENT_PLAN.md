# Wearables Platform Phase One Development Plan

## Objective
Deliver a production-ready wearable ingestion layer that aligns with OpenXR interaction profiles while maintaining backward compatibility with existing adapters and telemetry consumers. This phase focuses on harmonizing schemas, runtime orchestration, and testing so the sensory stack can plug into XR runtimes without custom shims.

## Guiding Principles
- **Protocol alignment first:** Treat OpenXR interaction profiles and action semantics as the source of truth for naming, typing, and discovery contracts.
- **Composable adapters:** Preserve our pluggable adapter interface but refactor it to express OpenXR-style spaces, poses, and action sets.
- **Data fidelity:** Maintain high-resolution sampling, but normalize to OpenXR-compatible ranges and units before emission.
- **Observability:** Every change must expose health signals (latency, drop rate, license status) so telemetry and licensing tracks can integrate seamlessly.

## Workstreams & Milestones

### 1. Schema Harmonization (Week 1)
- Map existing sensor schemas to OpenXR structures (poses, actions, boolean/vector inputs) and define canonical descriptors in `SensorSchemaRegistry`.
- Introduce OpenXR interaction profile identifiers and vendor extensions into schema metadata.
- Add unit conversion utilities (e.g., radians, meters) and enforce them in normalization helpers.
- Deliverable: Updated registry with OpenXR-compliant schema exports and migration notes.

### 2. Adapter Refactor & Discovery (Week 2)
- Refactor `BaseWearableDeviceAdapter` to surface OpenXR action sets, spaces, and binding hints.
- Implement discovery contracts that mirror OpenXR runtime negotiation (device capabilities, optional extensions, failure codes).
- Update existing AR visor, neural band, and biometric adapters to use the new contract.
- Deliverable: Adapter suite passing revised integration tests, emitting OpenXR-aligned metadata.

### 3. Sensory Bridge Integration (Week 3)
- Update `SensoryInputBridge` to register OpenXR action sets, manage per-space transforms, and reconcile composite channels with OpenXR localization.
- Ensure snapshot tracking maintains OpenXR reference space context for downstream consumers.
- Introduce latency budgeting and QoS hooks for telemetry alignment.
- Deliverable: Bridge emitting OpenXR-compatible telemetry payloads with backward-compatible APIs.

### 4. Runtime Validation & Compatibility (Week 4)
- Create conformance test harness simulating OpenXR runtimes (e.g., action binding negotiation, sample replay).
- Validate licensing gates trigger the same states as OpenXR runtime expectations (permission denied, runtime unavailable).
- Document integration patterns for downstream UI/web telemetry track.
- Deliverable: Test suite coverage reports and integration guidance.

### 5. Documentation & Hand-off (Week 4)
- Produce developer guides covering schema definitions, adapter implementation checklist, and bridge integration steps.
- Update SDK typings to reflect new interfaces and migration aides.
- Coordinate with UI/web telemetry track on shared artifacts (event envelopes, license codes).
- Deliverable: Published docs and type definitions merged with sign-off from adjacent tracks.

## Dependencies & Coordination
- **Telemetry & Licensing Track:** Align on event envelopes, license status codes, and logging endpoints.
- **Runtime Research:** Monitor OpenXR vendor extensions for neural input and biometric telemetry.
- **QA Automation:** Provide early builds of the conformance harness for integration into continuous testing.

## Risk Mitigation
- **Schema Drift:** Introduce automated validation comparing registry exports with OpenXR XML descriptors each release.
- **Performance Regressions:** Gate adapter changes behind performance budgets and synthetic load tests.
- **Licensing Misalignment:** Coordinate with licensing services to mirror OpenXR runtime denial flows before rollout.

## Success Criteria
- All wearable adapters emit telemetry conforming to OpenXR naming and unit conventions.
- Sensory bridge passes conformance harness scenarios and maintains latency within agreed budgets.
- SDK consumers adopt the updated types without breaking changes, aided by migration utilities.
- Documentation enables new adapters to be built with OpenXR alignment in under one sprint.
