# Adaptive Engine Work Session Log

## 2025-10-07 – Session 01
- **Who:** Core Team Lead (agent)
- **Focus Areas:**
  - Environment readiness check for adaptive development.
  - Deep viability assessment of adaptive stack as commercial core.
  - Planning updates to ensure ongoing documentation and tracking.
- **Actions Taken:**
  1. Ran `npm install` to sync Node dependencies (no repo changes committed).
  2. Attempted `npx playwright install` and `npx playwright install-deps`; aborted due to heavy system package requirements after validating the risk (logged for follow-up).
  3. Authored the [Adaptive Engine Core Viability Assessment](../DOCS/ADAPTIVE_ENGINE_CORE_ASSESSMENT.md) capturing module-level strengths, gaps, and phased refactor strategy.
  4. Planned new tracker updates to reflect environment blockers and Phase 1 refactor tasks.
- **Decisions:**
  - Proceed with refactor (no rewrite) contingent on Phase 1–3 roadmap execution.
  - Defer full Playwright dependency installation until we evaluate lighter-weight browser automation options or container base images.
- **Risks/Issues Raised:**
  - Environment setup requires ~500 MB of OS packages; we need an approved path before making it a standard prerequisite.
  - Lack of formal SDK boundary remains the top technical blocker for commercialization.
- **Next Planned Actions:**
  1. Update `PLANNING/ADAPTIVE_ENGINE_TRACKER.md` with environment blocker status and new sprint/backlog items.
  2. Draft a modularization brief for layout/telemetry refactor (Phase 2 seeding).
  3. Evaluate alternative testing stacks (e.g., Vitest + jsdom) before committing to Playwright-deps installation.
