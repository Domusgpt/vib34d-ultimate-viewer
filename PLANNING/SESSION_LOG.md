# Adaptive Engine Work Session Log

## 2025-10-07 – Session 01
- **Who:** Core Team Lead (agent)
- **Focus Areas:**
  - Environment readiness check for adaptive development.
  - Deep viability assessment of adaptive stack as commercial core.
  - Planning updates to ensure ongoing documentation and tracking.
- **Actions Taken:**
  1. Ran `npm install` to sync Node dependencies (no repo changes committed).
  2. Attempted `npx playwright install` and `npx playwright install-deps`; aborted due to heavy system package requirements after validating the risk (logged for follow-up).
  3. Authored the [Adaptive Engine Core Viability Assessment](../DOCS/ADAPTIVE_ENGINE_CORE_ASSESSMENT.md) capturing module-level strengths, gaps, and phased refactor strategy.
  4. Planned new tracker updates to reflect environment blockers and Phase 1 refactor tasks.
- **Decisions:**
  - Proceed with refactor (no rewrite) contingent on Phase 1–3 roadmap execution.
  - Defer full Playwright dependency installation until we evaluate lighter-weight browser automation options or container base images.
- **Risks/Issues Raised:**
  - Environment setup requires ~500 MB of OS packages; we need an approved path before making it a standard prerequisite.
  - Lack of formal SDK boundary remains the top technical blocker for commercialization.
- **Next Planned Actions:**
  1. Update `PLANNING/ADAPTIVE_ENGINE_TRACKER.md` with environment blocker status and new sprint/backlog items.
  2. Draft a modularization brief for layout/telemetry refactor (Phase 2 seeding).
  3. Evaluate alternative testing stacks (e.g., Vitest + jsdom) before committing to Playwright-deps installation.

## 2025-10-08 – Session 02

  - Deliver remote compliance storage adapters to complete telemetry export persistence (B-12).
  - Refresh documentation, tracker status, and tests to reflect the new reusable assets.
- **Actions Taken:**
  1. Extracted the consent UI into `src/ui/components/ConsentPanel.js`, updated `wearable-designer.html` to consume it, and added Vitest coverage for the component’s lifecycle and download workflow.
  2. Implemented `createSignedS3StorageAdapter` and `createLogBrokerStorageAdapter`, enhanced the compliance vault to handle async storage, and expanded tests to cover async persistence paths.
  3. Updated README, telemetry privacy guide, SDK boundary proposal, tracker, session log, and type definitions to surface the reusable consent component and remote storage adapters.
- **Decisions:**
  - Marked backlog items B-11 and B-12 complete; future work will harden remote adapters with encryption/retention policies rather than new core features.
  - Treat `createConsentPanel` as the baseline consent experience for partner kits, ensuring demos and plug-ins stay aligned.
- **Risks/Issues Raised:**
  - Remote storage adapters currently rely on partner-provided signing endpoints; lack of standardized encryption could block regulated customers.
  - Additional telemetry provider signing/authentication remains unresolved (ties back to B-01 scope expansion).
- **Next Planned Actions:**
  1. Document encryption and retention requirements for remote storage adapters and engage compliance stakeholders.
  2. Expand SDK boundary docs to cover provider signing expectations and consent component customization hooks.
  3. Evaluate CI/browser automation strategy (B-07) now that Vitest coverage spans the new UI component.

## 2025-10-15 – Session 09

  2. Updated the Telemetry Privacy & Consent Guide, SDK boundary proposal, README, and type definitions to describe the new retention/encryption controls and consent customization contract.
  3. Authored the Environment Automation Plan outlining unit vs. smoke vs. visual lanes, CI caching strategy, and next review cadence; marked tracker item B-07 complete and logged the session outcome.
- **Decisions:**
  - Require all remote compliance exports to declare a retention strategy and forward encryption metadata for downstream auditing.
  - Treat request-signing middleware as part of the SDK boundary so partner providers cannot bypass consent/licensing checks.
  - Adopt Chromium-only Playwright smoke jobs as the interim automation target while full matrix runs remain optional.
- **Risks/Issues Raised:**
  - Playwright smoke tags still need to be authored; without them the automation plan cannot be enforced in CI.
  - Remote adapters rely on partner-provided encryption hooks—need validation templates to ensure consistent implementations.
- **Next Planned Actions:**
  1. Author Playwright smoke specs for the consent panel + compliance export flow and tag them `@smoke`.
  2. Draft encryption template examples (KMS wrapper, envelope metadata) for partner teams adopting the remote adapters.
  3. Continue SDK boundary hardening by formalizing request signing middleware and publishing example provider configurations.

## 2025-10-16 – Session 10
- **Who:** Core Team Lead (agent)
- **Focus Areas:**
  - Deliver the first Playwright `@smoke` spec for the consent/compliance workflow per the automation plan.
  - Formalize telemetry request signing middleware so providers can enforce licensed exports.
  - Package encryption template guidance for remote compliance adapters and update SDK docs accordingly.
- **Actions Taken:**

  2. Added request middleware registration to `ProductTelemetryHarness`, extended `HttpTelemetryProvider` to execute middleware, and exposed helper methods through `AdaptiveInterfaceEngine`/`createAdaptiveSDK` with fresh Vitest coverage.
  3. Published `createRequestSigningMiddleware`, introduced encryption template documentation, and refreshed privacy/SDK boundary guidance plus the session tracker entry.
- **Decisions:**
  - Treat request middleware as the canonical path for partner signing/auth layers across all telemetry providers.
  - Anchor smoke automation on the consent/compliance flow before expanding to broader wearable scenarios.
- **Risks/Issues Raised:**
  - CI still needs cached Playwright binaries and scripting to run the new smoke lane.
  - Encryption templates require review from compliance/legal before being shared with partners.
- **Next Planned Actions:**
  1. Wire the Chromium smoke lane into CI using cached browsers per the automation plan.
  2. Publish provider configuration samples that consume `createRequestSigningMiddleware`.
  3. Collect stakeholder feedback on the encryption templates and incorporate regulatory requirements.

## 2025-10-17 – Session 11
- **Who:** Core Team Lead (agent)
- **Focus Areas:**
  - Establish license enforcement as part of the SDK boundary and telemetry workflow (B-01 follow-up).
  - Provide reusable licensing APIs/definitions for partner integrations and commercialization tooling.
  - Refresh documentation, tracker, and tests to capture the new monetization guardrails.
- **Actions Taken:**
  1. Implemented `src/product/licensing/LicenseManager.js` with validator orchestration, history tracking, feature gating, and status subscriptions, plus Vitest coverage for validation, expiry, and feature checks.
  2. Integrated the license manager into `ProductTelemetryHarness` and `createAdaptiveSDK`, gating `identify`/`track` calls, exposing `setLicense`/`validateLicense`, and updating type definitions and SDK packaging guidance.
  3. Updated README, architecture review, telemetry privacy guide, SDK boundary proposal, tracker/backlog, and session log to document the new license workflow and queued B-13 attestation follow-up.
- **Decisions:**
  - Treat the license manager as part of the Phase 1 SDK surface; remote attestation/entitlement sync moves to new backlog item B-13.
  - Block telemetry by default when licenses are missing/invalid to avoid unmonetized deployments.
- **Risks/Issues Raised:**
  - License validation currently runs locally; remote revocation, tenant entitlements, and customer support tooling still required.
  - Need provider configuration samples illustrating license-aware onboarding flows for plug-ins.
- **Next Planned Actions:**
  1. Prototype remote attestation + revocation checks (B-13) and feed outcomes into telemetry audit trails.
  2. Document partner onboarding workflow covering license provisioning, renewal, and support escalation.
  3. Prepare consent/compliance smoke CI integration once license gating is validated end-to-end.

  - Deliver the B-13 remote license attestation pipeline with scheduling, revocation checks, and entitlement sync.
  - Surface attestation history and controls through the Adaptive SDK + telemetry harness for partner integrations.
  - Update documentation, types, and planning artifacts to reflect the new commercialization milestone.
- **Actions Taken:**
  1. Implemented `RemoteLicenseAttestor` with attestation/revocation/entitlement fetches, scheduling, history, and fail-open support, binding it to the license manager and telemetry harness.
  2. Extended `AdaptiveSDK` and `ProductTelemetryHarness` with attestor configuration, new license helper APIs, and audit wiring; added Vitest coverage for the attestor, harness events, and SDK helpers.
  3. Documented the attestation workflow across README, SDK boundary proposal, privacy guide, architecture/core assessments, tracker, and session log while marking backlog item B-13 complete.
- **Decisions:**
  - Default remote attestation to fail-closed unless integrators explicitly opt into fail-open via configuration.
  - Treat attestation scheduling metadata (`nextCheckInMs`, `ttlMs`) as the canonical cadence and record audit events for each schedule/error path.
- **Risks/Issues Raised:**
  - Need partner endpoint schema docs and SLA definitions for the attestor before external roll-out.
  - Signed provider integrations remain outstanding; next focus is publishing configuration samples that layer attestation + signing.
- **Next Planned Actions:**
  1. Draft partner-facing attestation endpoint profiles (payload/response contracts, retry guidance, SLA expectations).
  2. Expand telemetry provider samples to combine request signing middleware with attestation metadata.
  3. Continue wiring the consent/compliance Playwright smoke lane into CI alongside new license checks.

## 2025-10-19 – Session 13
- **Who:** Core Team Lead (agent)
- **Focus Areas:**
  - Package remote license attestation endpoints into reusable profiles for commercialization teams (B-13 follow-up).
  - Expose profile registration/apply APIs through the telemetry harness and Adaptive SDK surface.
  - Refresh documentation, types, and planning artifacts to capture the new profile catalog workflow.
- **Actions Taken:**
  1. Authored `LicenseAttestationProfileRegistry` and wired it into `ProductTelemetryHarness` and `AdaptiveInterfaceEngine` with audit trails for profile registration, defaults, and applications.
  2. Extended `createAdaptiveSDK` to accept/register attestation profiles during bootstrap, expose new helper APIs, and updated Vitest suites plus a dedicated registry test.
  3. Updated README, architecture/core assessments, SDK boundary proposal, telemetry privacy guide, tracker, and type definitions to document the profile registry milestone and partner packaging expectations.
- **Decisions:**
  - Treat license attestation profiles as first-class SDK assets so partner teams can ship curated endpoint/SLA bundles without forking the attestor implementation.
  - Log profile registration/application events in the telemetry audit trail to maintain compliance visibility across deployments.
- **Risks/Issues Raised:**
  - Partner-facing documentation for profile schemas, SLA defaults, and retry guidance is still pending.
  - Need to coordinate monetization catalog persistence so profile metadata aligns with entitlement packaging.
- **Next Planned Actions:**
  1. Draft external documentation for attestation profiles (payload templates, SLA expectations, segmentation guidance).
  2. Bundle sample profile packs for early adopter partners and integrate them into onboarding collateral.
  3. Continue wiring signed telemetry provider examples that consume both request middleware and attestation profile metadata.

## 2025-10-20 – Session 14
- **Who:** Core Team Lead (agent)
- **Focus Areas:**
  - Package attestation profiles into reusable packs with SDK/bootstrap helpers and partner-facing documentation.
  - Extend telemetry harness + Adaptive SDK surfaces so packs can be registered/audited alongside individual profiles.
  - Update commercialization artifacts (README, planning docs, privacy guide) to reflect the new catalog milestone.
- **Actions Taken:**
  1. Authored `LicenseAttestationProfileCatalog` with enterprise/studio/indie builders, registration helpers, and documentation plus Vitest coverage.
  2. Extended `ProductTelemetryHarness`, `AdaptiveInterfaceEngine`, and `createAdaptiveSDK` with pack registration APIs, bootstrap options, and audit events while updating type definitions.
  3. Added Vitest suites for pack bootstrap/runtime flows, introduced a catalog-focused doc, refreshed SDK/telemetry docs, tracker, and session log.
- **Decisions:**
  - Default pack registration applies the pack's default profile unless integrators opt out with `applyDefault: false`.
  - Catalog defaults favor descriptive SLA metadata (`responseTargetMs`, `availability`, `breachWindowMs`) to simplify compliance dashboards.
- **Risks/Issues Raised:**
  - Need partner feedback on whether the initial enterprise/studio/indie packs cover region/tier granularity; healthcare/education packs remain outstanding.
  - Catalog metadata isn't yet wired into commercialization analytics dashboards.
- **Next Planned Actions:**
  1. Gather partner feedback on catalog coverage and prioritize additional packs (healthcare, education, government).
  2. Connect pack metadata to commercialization dashboards/reporting to visualize entitlement coverage.
  3. Continue exploring signed provider examples that combine request middleware with pack-driven SLA metadata.

## 2025-10-21 – Session 15
- **Who:** Core Team Lead (agent)
- **Focus Areas:**
  - Translate attestation pack metadata into commercial coverage analytics and surface it through SDK APIs.
  - Update wearable demo to visualise commercialization coverage for stakeholders.
  - Refresh documentation, tracker, and planning artifacts with the new analytics bridge.
- **Actions Taken:**
  1. Implemented `LicenseCommercializationReporter`, wired it into `ProductTelemetryHarness`/`AdaptiveSDK`, and exposed commercialization summary getters.
  2. Added commercialization coverage panel to `wearable-designer.html` driven by the new summaries, registering enterprise/studio packs at bootstrap.
  3. Authored commercialization analytics documentation, updated README/plan/tracker entries, and expanded Vitest coverage (`license-commercialization-reporter.test.js`, harness updates).
- **Decisions:**
  - Treat commercialization summaries as first-class telemetry output so partner dashboards avoid duplicating attestation audit logic.
  - Use SDK callbacks (`telemetry.commercialization.onUpdate`) for live UI updates while persisting follow-up work for long-term storage.
- **Risks/Issues Raised:**
  - Need to persist commercialization summaries for longitudinal KPI reporting before exposing them to enterprise portals.
  - Additional attestation packs (healthcare/education) will require new segment metadata and analytics baselines.
- **Next Planned Actions:**
  1. Define persistence strategy (daily snapshots, BI export integration) for commercialization summaries.
  2. Expand catalog coverage to healthcare/education segments with accompanying analytics metadata.
  3. Wire commercialization feed into partner dashboards/portal concepts and gather stakeholder feedback.

## 2025-10-22 – Session 16
- **Who:** Core Team Lead (agent)
- **Focus Areas:**
  - Persist commercialization KPI snapshots and expose BI-friendly exports through the SDK.
  - Upgrade wearable demo UX so stakeholders can capture/export commercialization metrics without code.
  - Backfill documentation, tracker, and tests to reflect the new commercialization persistence workflow.
- **Actions Taken:**
  1. Implemented `LicenseCommercializationSnapshotStore`, integrated it with `ProductTelemetryHarness`/`AdaptiveInterfaceEngine`/`createAdaptiveSDK`, and added scheduling helpers.
  2. Enhanced `wearable-designer.html` with snapshot controls, KPI delta rendering, and export downloads driven by the new SDK APIs.
  3. Authored snapshot store Vitest suites, expanded harness/reporter coverage, refreshed commercialization analytics docs, and logged tracker/session updates.
- **Decisions:**
  - Enable snapshot capture by default (unless `commercialization.snapshotStore === false`) so telemetry consumers automatically build KPI history.
  - Surface exports in JSON and CSV formats to support both API-driven dashboards and spreadsheet-driven stakeholder reviews.
- **Risks/Issues Raised:**
  - External persistence (vault/S3) still needs to be wired before enterprise rollout; follow-up scheduled under B-13.
  - KPI exports currently omit healthcare/education pack metadata pending catalog expansion.
- **Next Planned Actions:**
  1. Prototype durable storage adapters for commercialization snapshots alongside compliance vault exports.
  2. Extend attestation pack catalog with healthcare/education metadata wired into KPI summaries.
  3. Draft partner-facing dashboard examples leveraging the new CSV/JSON exports.

## 2025-10-23 – Session 17
- **Who:** Core Team Lead (agent)
- **Focus Areas:**
  - Ship commercialization remote persistence adapters and async hydration support for partner dashboards.
  - Demonstrate the remote upload workflow inside the wearable designer experience with KPI-ready logging.
  - Backfill docs, types, and tests so SDK consumers can rely on the new storage builders.
- **Actions Taken:**
  1. Extended `LicenseCommercializationSnapshotStore` with async storage support, `whenReady()`, and storage append/clear hooks; published commercialization snapshot storage adapters (generic + signed S3).
  2. Wired the wearable designer demo to the new remote storage adapter, added a persistence log UI, redacted license data before uploads, and waited on `whenReady()` for KPI hydration.
  3. Added Vitest coverage for async storage and S3 adapters, refreshed commercialization analytics/SDK boundary docs, updated README/tracker/session records, and exposed new helpers in the type definitions.
- **Decisions:**
  - Default remote commercialization uploads to omit summaries and redact `licenseKey` while allowing partners to opt back in via adapter options.
  - Promote `whenReady()` as the handshake for dashboards so UI surfaces only render once remote hydration completes.
- **Risks/Issues Raised:**
  - Remote adapters still need retry/backoff policies and error telemetry before production rollout.
  - Nightly export scheduling is documented but the demo uses a shorter cadence; alignment with partner SLAs remains.
- **Next Planned Actions:**
  1. Add retry/backoff and failure instrumentation to commercialization remote storage adapters.
  2. Connect scheduled snapshot exports to downstream partner BI pipelines (S3/log broker destinations).
  3. Draft partner dashboard examples that consume the remote persistence payloads and highlight KPI trend deltas.

## 2025-10-24 – Session 18
- **Who:** Core Team Lead (agent)
- **Focus Areas:**
  - Move past licensing/commercialization work by delivering projection-focused runtime features.
  - Expose projection blueprints through the SDK and wearable demo so partners can inspect focus/depth choreography.
  - Document and test the new projection workflow while updating roadmap artifacts.
- **Actions Taken:**
  1. Implemented `ProjectionFieldComposer`, wired it into `AdaptiveInterfaceEngine`/`AdaptiveSDK`, and added Vitest coverage for composer + SDK blueprint helpers.
  2. Expanded `wearable-designer.html` with a projection blueprint panel, metrics, and styling so stakeholders can visualize channel timelines/depth targets live.
  3. Refreshed README, architecture/core assessments, product plan, SDK boundary proposal, tracker, and session log to reflect the new projection blueprint milestone.
- **Decisions:**
  - Keep default projection channels lightweight while allowing SDK consumers to replace them via configuration rather than forcing a catalog today.
  - Surface coherence as the top-level demo metric for projection updates to communicate health without overwhelming designers.
- **Risks/Issues Raised:**
  - Projection blueprint APIs still lack partner-facing docs and TypeScript contracts; follow-up scheduled under B-15 documentation tasks.
  - Need to capture export/serialization examples so blueprint data can flow into partner toolchains (Figma/Webflow) without bespoke integrations.
- **Next Planned Actions:**
  1. Author blueprint integration guidance and TypeScript types for projection helpers.
  2. Prototype a small React/Web Component wrapper around the projection panel for reuse in partner dashboards.
  3. Validate projection timelines against additional sensor scenarios (gesture-heavy, low-light) to tune defaults before publishing packs.

## 2025-10-24 – Session 19
- **Who:** Core Team Lead (agent)
- **Focus Areas:**
  - Layer scenario heuristics on top of the projection composer so partners can rehearse gesture/ambient contexts.
  - Expose scenario simulation APIs via the Adaptive SDK and wearable demo to demonstrate non-live blueprint analysis.
  - Backfill docs, tracker, and tests to reflect the new scenario tooling and commercialization story.
- **Actions Taken:**
  1. Implemented `ProjectionScenarioSimulator` with gesture-intensive, low-light, and ambient crowd presets plus channel metrics; wired registration/simulation APIs through `AdaptiveInterfaceEngine` and `createAdaptiveSDK`.
  2. Enhanced `wearable-designer.html` with scenario toggles, metrics grid, and live/simulation mode switching so stakeholders can compare live vs. what-if projection outputs.
  3. Added Vitest suites for the simulator + SDK scenario APIs, refreshed README/docs/tracker entries, and logged the milestone as backlog item B-16.
- **Decisions:**
  - Default scenario presets stay opinionated (gesture, low-light, crowd) while inviting partners to register custom overlays via SDK helper methods.
  - Live feed remains the default panel view; simulations annotate metadata instead of overriding telemetry flows to avoid conflating staged outputs with production signals.
- **Risks/Issues Raised:**
  - Scenario integration guidance (TypeScript contracts, partner docs) is still pending; flagged as follow-up under B-16.
  - Need additional sensor presets (neural intent spikes, ambient low-motion) and Playwright coverage once scenario UI stabilizes.
- **Next Planned Actions:**
  1. Draft partner-facing projection scenario integration notes and update TypeScript definitions.
  2. Add gesture-heavy and low-light edge-case suites beyond current Vitest coverage.
  3. Explore modularizing the projection panel into a reusable wrapper (React/Web Component) per earlier roadmap items.
