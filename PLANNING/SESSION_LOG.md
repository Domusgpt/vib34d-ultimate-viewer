# Adaptive Engine Work Session Log

## 2025-10-07 – Session 01
- **Who:** Core Team Lead (agent)
- **Focus Areas:**
  - Environment readiness check for adaptive development.
  - Deep viability assessment of adaptive stack as commercial core.
  - Planning updates to ensure ongoing documentation and tracking.
- **Actions Taken:**
  1. Ran `npm install` to sync Node dependencies (no repo changes committed).
  2. Attempted `npx playwright install` and `npx playwright install-deps`; aborted due to heavy system package requirements after validating the risk (logged for follow-up).
  3. Authored the [Adaptive Engine Core Viability Assessment](../DOCS/ADAPTIVE_ENGINE_CORE_ASSESSMENT.md) capturing module-level strengths, gaps, and phased refactor strategy.
  4. Planned new tracker updates to reflect environment blockers and Phase 1 refactor tasks.
- **Decisions:**
  - Proceed with refactor (no rewrite) contingent on Phase 1–3 roadmap execution.
  - Defer full Playwright dependency installation until we evaluate lighter-weight browser automation options or container base images.
- **Risks/Issues Raised:**
  - Environment setup requires ~500 MB of OS packages; we need an approved path before making it a standard prerequisite.
  - Lack of formal SDK boundary remains the top technical blocker for commercialization.
- **Next Planned Actions:**
  1. Update `PLANNING/ADAPTIVE_ENGINE_TRACKER.md` with environment blocker status and new sprint/backlog items.
  2. Draft a modularization brief for layout/telemetry refactor (Phase 2 seeding).
  3. Evaluate alternative testing stacks (e.g., Vitest + jsdom) before committing to Playwright-deps installation.

## 2025-10-08 – Session 02
- **Who:** Core Team Lead (agent)
- **Focus Areas:**
  - Document lightweight testing stack recommendation to unblock automation planning.
  - Define modularization blueprint for layout and telemetry layers.
  - Update tracker artifacts to reflect new decisions and deliverables.
- **Actions Taken:**
  1. Authored the [Adaptive Engine Testing Stack Evaluation](../DOCS/TESTING_STACK_EVALUATION.md) recommending Vitest + jsdom for Phase 1 and keeping Playwright optional.
  2. Produced the [Layout & Telemetry Modularization Brief](../DOCS/LAYOUT_TELEMETRY_MODULARIZATION_BRIEF.md) outlining strategy/provider interfaces and acceptance criteria.
  3. Updated `PLANNING/ADAPTIVE_ENGINE_TRACKER.md` with the Vitest checklist item, backlog status changes, and new sprint/completed log entries.
- **Decisions:**
  - Adopt Vitest + jsdom as the default automated test stack for Phase 1 while deferring Playwright browser installs to optional workflows.
  - Close backlog item B-08 with the published modularization brief; treat subsequent work as implementation tasks under Phase 2.
- **Risks/Issues Raised:**
  - Dependency installation for Vitest still pending; must ensure additions do not conflict with existing Playwright tooling.
  - Need to socialize modularization plan with partner tooling teams to confirm compatibility with plug-in roadmaps.
- **Next Planned Actions:**
  1. Update `package.json` with Vitest/jsdom dependencies and scaffold baseline tests.
  2. Draft SDK boundary proposal supporting dependency injection model described in the modularization brief.
 3. Coordinate with experience team on migration checklist for `wearable-designer.html` once modular interfaces land.

## 2025-10-09 – Session 03
- **Who:** Core Team Lead (agent)
- **Focus Areas:**
  - Execute Vitest + jsdom adoption to unblock adaptive module coverage.
  - Capture commercialization-facing specs (SDK boundary, migration checklist).
  - Close out environment readiness follow-ups noted in prior sessions.
- **Actions Taken:**
  1. Added Vitest/jsdom dependencies, scripts, and config; authored baseline unit suites for `SpatialLayoutSynthesizer` and `ProductTelemetryHarness`.
  2. Published the [Adaptive SDK Boundary Proposal](../DOCS/SDK_BOUNDARY_PROPOSAL.md) describing public surface, DI model, and packaging roadmap.
  3. Created the [Wearable Designer Migration Checklist](WEARABLE_DESIGNER_MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md) to guide demo refactor activities.
- **Decisions:**
  - Marked environment audit complete now that Vitest stack is configured; Playwright remains optional until B-07 resolves.
  - Began backlog item B-01 with the authored SDK boundary proposal to steer upcoming implementation work.
- **Risks/Issues Raised:**
  - `npm install` surfaced four moderate vulnerabilities; schedule follow-up security review once dependency graph stabilizes.
  - Vitest currently emits deprecation warning about CJS API usage—track for future tooling update.
- **Next Planned Actions:**
  1. Extend Vitest coverage to sensor normalization once channel abstractions land.
  2. Break down B-01 into implementation tickets aligned with the SDK boundary proposal.
  3. Coordinate with experience team to prioritize wearable designer migration once runtime factory is in place.
