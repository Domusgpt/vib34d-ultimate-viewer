# Wearables Spatial Development Execution Log

## Purpose
This document consolidates our active development strategy for the wearables runtime as we extend it toward OpenXR/WebXR spatial interoperability. It captures the architectural context that guides implementation choices and establishes a per-turn execution log so progress stays transparent and aligned with the agreed roadmap.

## Architecture Snapshot
### Runtime Orchestration
- **SensoryInputBridge** centralizes adapter lifecycle management, schema validation, bounded history, and snapshot emission for wearable channels, enabling consistent routing and telemetry across the adaptive interface engine.
- **WearableDeviceManager** wraps the bridge to register adapters, subscribe to device-level updates, and proxy ingestion without duplicating orchestration concerns.

### Schema Normalization
- **SensorSchemaRegistry** provides reusable validators and composite builders that normalize wearable payloads, enforce required channels, and surface field-level issues for downstream consumers.

### Adapter Layer
- **BaseWearableDeviceAdapter** handles licensing gates, telemetry metadata, trace playback/transport ingestion, and channel compaction while allowing device-specific subclasses to focus on normalization.

## Strategic Focus Areas
1. **Standards Alignment** – Map OpenXR/WebXR interaction profiles, hit-test semantics, spatial anchors, and environmental sensing onto existing schemas to ensure compatibility without re-platforming.
2. **Spatial Data Pipeline** – Extend registry/bridge/adapters to ingest spatial meshes, planes, depth, and lighting signals with confidence clamping and temporal coherence guarantees.
3. **SDK & Tooling Evolution** – Surface new spatial capabilities through adaptive SDK typings, developer tooling, and diagnostics while maintaining backward compatibility for current wearable integrations.
4. **Telemetry & Licensing** – Preserve auditability by threading telemetry scopes/classifications through new adapters and ensuring feature gating aligns with licensing policies.

## Execution Rhythm
- Each turn produces a concrete deliverable (code, tests, or validated documentation) that advances the strategic focus areas above.
- The execution log (below) records objectives, artifacts, and next actions after every turn so stakeholders can audit progress and course-correct quickly.

## Turn Execution Log
| Turn Timestamp (UTC) | Focus | Deliverables | Next Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2025-02-14T00:00 | Establish execution log & reaffirm architecture | This document summarizing runtime architecture, strategy, and cadence expectations. | Prioritize spatial schema extensions for hit testing & anchors integration, preparing adapter shims and validation harnesses. |

## Maintenance Notes
- Update the **Architecture Snapshot** if core runtime abstractions materially change.
- Append a new row to the **Turn Execution Log** after each development turn, capturing tangible outputs and the immediate follow-up target.
- Reference supporting design memos (OpenXR alignment, WebXR spatial plan) when sequencing complex spatial capabilities to maintain cross-team alignment.
